    "reasoning": "No selection met the high-confidence criteria for a BACK or LAY bet after cross-validating form, ratings, and market sentiment. Smart Vision was a strong contender but market drift and mixed recent form narratives advised caution. Ingleby Archie showed recent wins but a poor last run and negative market sentiment were significant detractors. Other runners lacked compelling data to justify a position.",
