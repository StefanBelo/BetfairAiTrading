# 🐎🤖 NEW: Horse Racing EV Analysis R2 - Timeform Edition

**TL;DR**: Just released our most sophisticated horse racing AI strategy yet - integrating Timeform's professional 75+ year racing expertise with advanced Expected Value calculations.

## What's New?

**🌟 Professional Timeform Integration**
- Uses Timeform's star rating system (1-5 stars)
- 15+ professional indicators including going suitability, trainer form, jockey records
- Leverages decades of racing expertise that pros rely on

**📊 Advanced Scoring System** 
- 200-point weighted analysis system
- Combines form, suitability, connections, and expert designations

- Form requirements (recent wins, current form, or improvement flags)
- Odds range 2.0-15.0, minimum €1000 market volume

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI strategies often miss the nuanced expertise that professional handicappers use. This strategy bridges that gap by:
- Incorporating Timeform's course specialization data
- Using going condition suitability analysis  
- Leveraging trainer/jockey combination history
- Applying professional improvement indicators

## Results So Far

Early testing shows the Timeform integration significantly improves selection quality by filtering out horses that look good on basic metrics but lack the professional edge factors that matter in real racing.
