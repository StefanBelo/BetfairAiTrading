## Understanding Betfair Exchange and Automated Betting

Betfair Exchange differentiates itself from traditional bookmakers by allowing users to bet against each other rather than against the house. This peer-to-peer model creates a marketplace where users can both back (bet for) and lay (bet against) outcomes, often resulting in better odds than traditional sportsbooks.

Automated betting on Betfair Exchange involves using software agents to execute trades based on predetermined conditions or algorithmic strategies. These AI agents connect to Betfair's API (Application Programming Interface), allowing them to:

- Monitor market conditions in real-time
- Place bets automatically when specific criteria are met
- Manage multiple markets simultaneously
- Execute strategies with speed and precision impossible for human traders
