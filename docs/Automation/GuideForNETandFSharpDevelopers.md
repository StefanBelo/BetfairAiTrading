# Getting Started with Programming for Betfair: A Guide for .NET and F# Developers

### What is the Betfair Sports Exchange?

The Betfair Sports Exchange is not a traditional bookmaker; instead, it functions as an exchange platform where users bet against each other's predictions. On Betfair, there are two main types of bets: **back bets** and **lay bets**. A back bet is a wager on an event happening, while a lay bet is a wager against an event occurring. For example, in a tennis match, you can place a lay bet on a specific player, predicting that they will not win the match.

Since Betfair allows both back and lay betting, it operates in a way similar to financial markets, enabling trading strategies. For instance, if you place a lay bet on a player at lower odds and their performance begins to decline during the match, you can then place a back bet at higher odds to "hedge" your position. This locks in a profit regardless of the final outcome of the match. Conversely, if your initial bet goes against you, hedging can help reduce your liability, allowing for a more flexible risk management approach.

### Important Reminder:
Betting always carries financial risks. If you’re not comfortable with these risks or feel particularly sensitive to them, it’s better to steer clear of betting altogether.

### About Betfair APIs:
Betfair currently provides access through **REST/JSON-RPC APIs** and the **Streaming API**. However, this wasn’t always the case. Back in 2007, when I embarked on this project, Betfair used SOAP-based services. At the time, developers had to pay a monthly fee of £200 to access the API. Later, with the introduction of REST APIs, the payment model changed to a one-time activation fee of £299.

When using the Bfexplorer app, you won't need to pay any additional fees for Betfair API access. Moreover, there's no need to write an extensive amount of code to handle API interactions and related functionalities. The app's backend already includes a comprehensive implementation of these features, allowing you to focus on utilizing existing tools and building on top of them, rather than starting from scratch. This provides a significant time-saving advantage, especially for those who wish to focus on strategy development or testing without dealing with the complexities of API integration.

For developers looking to explore strategies and experiment with coding ideas, such fees could be a significant barrier. This concern played a role in my decision to keep my main repository for this project private on platforms like GitHub. However, the **Bfexplorer BOT SDK** has been made available on GitHub:

[Bfexplorer BOT SDK Repository](https://github.com/StefanBelo/Bfexplorer-BOT-SDK)

That said, to my knowledge, the SDK hasn’t gained much traction, and I ultimately ceased updating the code.

### Current Development in Bfexplorer:
Despite reduced activity on the BOT SDK repository, the **Bfexplorer App** still supports numerous ways to extend its functionality. These include plugins, tools, bot strategies, console scripts, and, more recently, MCP server integration. This has made the app more adaptive, making it compatible with **AI agents** that can employ models, support tools, and interact directly with user prompts within the platform. If you’re curious about my work in this area, you can find my test repository on GitHub:

### How to Get Started:
For those new to Betfair or the Bfexplorer ecosystem, here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Register on Betfair:** Ensure you’re in a country where Betfair is legally accessible.
2. **Install the Bfexplorer App:** Once registered, download and install the app.
3. **Activate API Access:** Log in to Betfair through the Bfexplorer app to enable API functionality.

### Practice Mode:

The Bfexplorer app includes a **Practice Mode** where all bet placements are simulated, meaning no real bets are placed on the Betfair exchange. This is an ideal feature for testing strategies and experimenting without risking actual money. I strongly recommend using this feature for experimentation, especially when working with the Bfexplorer BOT SDK. In fact, when using the SDK, Practice Mode is enabled by default.

### Technology Stack for Getting Started:

If you’re interested in programming with F# or any other .NET-based language, there are a variety of areas where you can dive in:

1. **Sports Data Retrieval:**
   Access publicly available data via APIs or by scraping websites to analyze trends or create strategies.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   Representing data graphically to gain better insights into betting or trading strategies.

3. **Machine Learning and AI:**
   Developing predictive models or intelligent systems for more informed decision-making in betting.

4. **Bot Strategy Development:**
   Automating and refining betting strategies to optimize performance in various markets.

### Example Script:

To start coding, here’s a simple **console script** example available on GitHub:

[Open My Football Markets by Score](https://github.com/StefanBelo/BetfairAiTrading/blob/main/src/Strategies/Football/OpenMyFootballMarketsByScore.fsx)

This script is a good demonstration of how to programmatically interact with the markets based on specific conditions like scores and events.
