# Using AI Agent Execution from Different Providers: Automation Approaches

This document describes several approaches for integrating and executing AI agent workflows in Betfair trading automation, focusing on how different programming and CLI solutions can be leveraged for strategy execution and debugging.

## 1. FastAgent Python Library

- **Approach:** Program a Python script for each exact strategy using the FastAgent library.
- **Usage:** Requires explicit scripting for every strategy, offering full control and flexibility.
- **Pros:**
  - Highly customizable.
  - Direct access to Python ecosystem and libraries.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires programming effort for each strategy.
  - Debugging is limited to script-level logs and outputs.

## 2. ChatCompletionsClient C# Library Integration

- **Approach:** Integrate the AI agent workflow directly into your trading application using the ChatCompletionsClient C# library.
- **Usage:** The execution prompt is loaded directly from a prompt file, eliminating the need to program a separate script for each strategy.
- **Pros:**
  - No need to write custom scripts for each strategy.
  - Seamless integration with C# trading applications.
  - Prompts can be managed and updated independently.
- **Cons:**
  - Debugging is challenging; the AI agent conversation is not directly visible.
  - Execution is single-session, limiting visibility into the agent's reasoning process.

## 3. Console Command Execution with AI CLI Tools

- **Approach:** Execute console commands using AI CLI tools such as Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or Qwen Code.
- **Usage:** Strategies are executed in a single session via command-line tools, with prompts provided as command arguments or files.
- **Pros:**
  - Quick setup and execution.
  - Supports a variety of AI providers.
- **Cons:**
  - Single-session execution makes debugging difficult.
  - The agent's conversation and reasoning are not directly accessible.

## 4. Direct CLI Tool Usage with Text Injection

- **Approach:** Use CLI tools directly, injecting text into the console application for strategy execution.
- **Usage:** This method supports multisession execution, allowing for more complex workflows and better debugging.
- **Pros:**
  - Multisession execution enables caching of tokens and efficient resource usage.
  - Direct visibility into prompt output and agent conversation during debugging.
  - Easier to iterate and refine prompts.
- **Cons:**
  - May require more setup for session management.
  - Depends on CLI tool capabilities and integration.

---

**Summary:**
- The FastAgent Python approach is best for full control and custom scripting.
- The ChatCompletionsClient C# integration offers a clever, script-free workflow but limits debugging visibility.
- Console command execution with AI CLI tools is fast but hard to debug due to single-session constraints.
- Direct CLI tool usage with text injection is the most flexible for debugging and multisession workflows, making it ideal for prompt development and iterative strategy refinement.

Choose the approach that best fits your automation, integration, and debugging needs.
