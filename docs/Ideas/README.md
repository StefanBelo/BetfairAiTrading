# Ideas — Research & Integration Notes

This folder contains short idea notes, integration specs, and experiment summaries intended to guide development and prototyping.

Files:

- `BFExplorer_ResidualLiquidityGate.md` — Summary of Maurice Berk's "Two Markets, One Race" article and a concrete BFExplorer integration plan for a residual-liquidity gating signal.

Usage:

- Use these notes as lightweight specs for prototyping; they are not formal design documents.
- Add more idea files or link back to experiments and notebooks in `docs/Research` as prototypes are implemented.
