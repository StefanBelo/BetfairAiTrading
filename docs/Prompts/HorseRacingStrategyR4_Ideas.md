# Horse Racing Strategy R4 - Comprehensive Race Analysis & Execution Prompt

## Overview
This prompt provides a systematic approach to analyzing horse racing markets using Racing Post data, form analysis, and Expected Value (EV) calculations to identify profitable betting opportunities.

## System Instructions

### Primary Objective
Analyze horse racing markets to identify the single best value betting opportunity by combining:
- Recent form analysis
- Rating comparisons (Official Rating vs Racing Post Rating)
- AI prediction scores
- Market pricing inefficiencies
- Expected Value calculations

**Selection Criteria**: Only recommend ONE selection per race that meets strict value thresholds. If no selection meets the criteria, recommend NO BET.

### Essential Data Collection Steps

#### Step 1: Get Active Betfair Market
```
Use: GetActiveBetfairMarket
Purpose: Retrieve current market information including:
- Market ID and basic details
- All runners with current prices
- Market status and start time
- Event information (venue, race type)
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve Racing Post Data
```
Use: GetDataContextForBetfairMarket
Parameters: 
- dataContextName: "RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo" 
- marketId: [from Step 1]
Purpose: Get comprehensive form data for all horses including:
- Recent race descriptions and performances
- Official ratings and Racing Post ratings
- Last run dates and beaten distances
- AI prediction scores
```

#### Step 3: Strategy Execution (When Selection Made)
```
When a dedicated selection is chosen for betting:

For BACK bets:
Use: ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings
Parameters:
- strategyName: "Bet 10 Euro"
- marketId: [from Step 1]
- selectionId: [selected horse's selectionId]

For LAY bets:
Use: ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings  
Parameters:
- strategyName: "Lay 10 Euro"
- marketId: [from Step 1]
- selectionId: [selected horse's selectionId]

Execute immediately after ActivateBetfairMarketSelection
```

#### Step 4: Data Storage and Analysis Tracking
```
After completing analysis (whether bet placed or NO BET):

Use: SetAIAgentDataContextForBetfairMarket
Parameters:
- dataContextName: "HorseRacingR4_Analysis"
- marketId: [from Step 1]
- jsonData: [Complete analysis results in JSON format - see Data Format section]

Purpose: Store comprehensive analysis data for:
- Model validation and improvement
- Performance tracking over time
- EV accuracy measurement
- Strategy refinement based on outcomes
```

## Analysis Framework

### Step 5: Data Validation & Setup
- Verify all runners are active and declared
- Cross-reference market data with Racing Post data
- Check race conditions (distance, course, going, class)
- Identify any non-runners or late market changes

### Step 6: Form Analysis Methodology

#### Recent Form Scoring (0-100 scale)
- **Last 7 days**: 100 points for win, 80 for 2nd, 60 for 3rd
- **8-14 days**: 90 points for win, 70 for 2nd, 50 for 3rd  
- **15-30 days**: 80 points for win, 60 for 2nd, 40 for 3rd
- **31+ days**: Reduce by 10% per additional week

#### Performance Quality Assessment
- Race descriptions analysis for finishing style
- Beaten distances in recent races
- Course and distance suitability
- Going preferences

### Step 7: Rating Analysis
- Compare Official Rating (OR) vs Racing Post Rating (RP)
- Calculate rating differential: `(RP - OR) / OR * 100`
- Weight adjustments and class level assessment

### Step 8: Expected Value Calculation

#### EV Formula
```
EV = (Probability × (Odds - 1)) - (1 - Probability)
```

Where:
- **Probability** = Estimated true chance of winning
- **Odds** = Current market decimal odds
- **Positive EV** = Value bet opportunity
- **Negative EV** = Avoid or lay opportunity

#### Probability Estimation Method
```
Base Probability = (Form Score × 0.4) + (Rating Score × 0.3) + (AI Score × 0.3)
Adjusted for field size and race conditions
```

## Race Analysis Table Template

| Horse | Current Price | Form Score | OR | RP | AI Score | Est. Prob % | True Odds | Market Odds | EV % | Action | Rating |
|-------|---------------|------------|----|----|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----|--------|--------|
| Horse A | 5.1 | 95 | 93 | 112 | 85 | 25.0% | 4.0 | 5.1 | +27.5% | BACK | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Horse B | 6.6 | 88 | 95 | 111 | 85 | 18.0% | 5.56 | 6.6 | +18.8% | BACK | ⭐⭐ |
| Horse C | 3.3 | 82 | 101 | 113 | 97 | 22.0% | 4.55 | 3.3 | -27.4% | LAY | ⭐⭐ |
| Horse D | 7.0 | 75 | 88 | 112 | 98 | 15.0% | 6.67 | 7.0 | +5.0% | E/W | ⭐ |
| Others | Various | - | - | - | - | 20.0% | - | - | - | AVOID | - |

### Column Explanations

#### Star Rating System
The Rating column uses a star system to indicate bet confidence and preference:

**For BACK Bets:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = **Premium Selection** (EV > +50%) - Maximum confidence, primary selection
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = **Strong Back** (EV +30% to +50%) - High confidence, secondary selection
- ⭐⭐⭐ = **Good Back** (EV +20% to +30%) - Solid value bet
- ⭐⭐ = **Moderate Back** (EV +10% to +20%) - Reasonable value
- ⭐ = **Weak Back** (EV +5% to +10%) - Marginal value, each-way consideration

**For LAY Bets:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = **Strong Lay** (EV < -30%) - Maximum confidence against
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = **Good Lay** (EV -20% to -30%) - High confidence lay
- ⭐⭐⭐ = **Moderate Lay** (EV -15% to -20%) - Solid lay opportunity
- ⭐⭐ = **Weak Lay** (EV -10% to -15%) - Marginal lay value
- ⭐ = **Slight Lay** (EV -5% to -10%) - Minor lay consideration

**Special Indicators:**
- **AVOID** = No rating (EV -5% to +5%) - No betting value
- **E/W** = ⭐ rating - Each-way value only

#### Form Score Calculation
```
Form Score = (Recent Win Points × Recency Weight) + (Consistency Bonus) + (Class Adjustment)

Example: Sample Horse
- Won 6 days ago: 100 × 1.0 = 100 points
- Consistency (3 wins in 6 runs): +10 points  
- Class level: No adjustment
- Final Score: 95/100
```

#### Rating Differential
```
Rating Diff = ((RP Rating - OR Rating) / OR Rating) × 100

Example: Sample Horse
- RP: 112, OR: 93
- Diff: ((112-93)/93) × 100 = +20.4%
- Indicates underrated by handicapper
```

#### AI Score Integration
```
AI Score Weight = Min(AI Prediction Score, 100)
- High scoring horses typically show consistency
- Scores above 95 indicate strong recent form
- Use as confidence indicator for selections
```

#### Probability Estimation
```
Base Probability = (Form × 0.4) + (Rating × 0.3) + (AI × 0.3)

Example: Sample Horse
- Form: 95 × 0.4 = 38
- Rating: 80 × 0.3 = 24 (adjusted for rating differential)
- AI: 85 × 0.3 = 25.5
- Total: 87.5/100 = Raw probability
- Field adjustment: 87.5 × (1/field_strength) = Final probability %
```

#### Expected Value Calculation
```
EV = (True Probability × (Market Odds - 1)) - (1 - True Probability)

Example: Sample Horse
- True Probability: 25% (0.25)
- Market Odds: 5.1
- EV = (0.25 × (5.1 - 1)) - (1 - 0.25)
- EV = (0.25 × 4.1) - 0.75
- EV = 1.025 - 0.75 = +0.275 (+27.5%)
```

## Strategy Execution Rules
