# Horse Racing Win Market Strategy Using Place Data Analysis

## Overview
This prompt analyzes horse racing win and place market data to identify tradin## Prompt Execution Command

```
For active betfair market, retrieve "HorseRacingWinToBePlacedData" and execute win market analysis focusing on:
1. Place market momentum as leading indicator
2. Win market value identification  
3. Risk-adjusted position recommendations
4. Clear entry/exit criteria for win bets only

After analysis, execute strategies on the best selection based on combined divergence strength:
- For BACK_WIN signals: Execute "Bet 10 Euro" on the selection with the most negative divergence (place shortening faster than win)
- For LAY_WIN signals: Execute "Lay 10 Euro" on the selection with the most positive divergence (place drifting faster than win, if current_win_odds < 3.0)
- Prioritize LAY_WIN if present and meets criteria, otherwise BACK_WIN
- Only execute if time_to_race > 3 minutes
- Report execution results and final strategy status
```in the **win market only**. The place market data serves as a key indicator of market sentiment and informed money flow, helping to identify value and momentum in the win market.

## Strategy Focus
- **Primary Market**: Win bets only
- **Supporting Data**: Place market movements for analysis
- **Objective**: Identify win market opportunities based on place market signals

## Data Analysis Framework

### 1. Market Divergence Signals
Look for these key patterns between win and place markets:

#### Strong Win Signal Indicators:
- **Place market shortening faster than win market**: Indicates informed money backing horse to finish in top positions
- **Stable place odds with drifting win odds**: Suggests market overreaction, potential win value
- **Heavy place volume with modest win volume**: Smart money may be building position before win market move

#### Weak Win Signal Indicators:
- **Win odds shortening while place odds stable/drift**: May indicate uninformed backing
- **Both markets drifting**: General lack of confidence
- **Place odds lengthening faster than win**: Market losing confidence in horse's ability to finish well

### 2. Execution Strategy

#### Win Market Entry Criteria:
```
IF place_odds_momentum < -0.1 (shortening)
AND win_odds_momentum >= -0.05 (stable or slight drift)
AND time_to_race > 3_minutes
THEN consider_backing_win_market
```

#### Win Market Lay Criteria:
```
IF place_odds_momentum > 0.1 (drifting)
AND win_odds_momentum < -0.1 (shortening rapidly)
AND current_win_odds < 3.0
THEN consider_laying_win_market
```

## Practical Implementation

### Analysis Prompt Template:
```
For the active horse racing market with "HorseRacingWinToBePlacedData":

1. **Calculate Momentum Indicators**:
   - Win odds momentum = (current_win_odds - initial_win_odds) / initial_win_odds * 100
   - Place odds momentum = (current_place_odds - initial_place_odds) / initial_place_odds * 100

2. **Calculate Combined Divergence Score**:
   - Divergence = place_momentum - win_momentum
   - Positive divergence: Place drifting faster than win (potential LAY opportunity)
   - Negative divergence: Place shortening faster than win (potential BACK opportunity)

3. **Identify Market Divergence**:
   - Compare win vs place momentum ratios
   - Look for horses where place market shows more confidence than win market
   - Flag significant divergences (>10% difference in momentum)

4. **Generate Win Market Strategy**:
   - **BACK** horses with: Strong place support (-5% or better) + stable/value win odds (Â±2%) + negative divergence (< -5%)
   - **LAY** horses with: Weak place support (+5% or worse) + artificially short win odds (-10% or more) + positive divergence (>5%)
   - **AVOID** horses with: Consistent negative momentum in both markets (+10% both)
   - **WATCH** horses with: Mixed signals or developing patterns

5. **Risk Management**:
   - Maximum 5% bankroll per race
   - Exit 90 seconds before race start
   - Stop loss at 20% of position
   - Profit target at 15% ROI

6. **Create Analysis Tables**:
   - Complete market overview table with all runners
   - Market analysis summary with key insights
   - Detailed movement analysis for primary targets
   - Strategy execution framework with specific parameters
```
