# Horse Racing Expected Value Analysis with Conservative Trading Data Strategy

## Conservative EV Analysis and Betting Execution Prompt (Trading Data Focus)

```
Task: Perform comprehensive Expected Value (EV) analysis for horse racing betting opportunities using market trading data with a conservative approach that prioritizes the market favorite when it demonstrates fair or better expected value. This analysis combines trading pattern interpretation with conservative risk management to identify value in market leaders while maintaining capital preservation focus.

Instructions:

1. **Market Data Retrieval**
   - Retrieve the active betfair market in BfexplorerApp using tool: GetActiveBetfairMarket
   - Save marketId for subsequent data retrieval
   - Make no preliminary reports during data collection

2. **Dual Data Source Collection**
   - Retrieve the data context with the name 'MarketSelectionsTradedPricesData' for the betfair market using tool: GetDataContextForBetfairMarket
   - Retrieve the data context with the name 'RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo' for the betfair market using tool: GetDataContextForBetfairMarket
   - Focus on 'tradedPricesData' field for trading analysis AND 'horsesData' field for performance analysis
   - Do not make any reports during data collection phase

3. **Combined Trading Pattern and Performance Analysis**   
   **CRITICAL: Price-Probability Relationship and Movement Analysis**
   - **Probability = 1 / Price** (e.g., price 4.0 = 25% probability, price 2.0 = 50% probability)
   - **Price Shortening** = Price DECREASING = Probability INCREASING = Positive market signal
   - **Price Drifting/Lengthening** = Price INCREASING = Probability DECREASING = Negative market signal
   - **IMPORTANT**: Calculate probability changes, not price changes, for market confidence assessment
   - **Example**: Price 7.4→6.4 = Probability 13.5%→15.6% = +15.6% probability improvement (POSITIVE signal)

   - Analyze each horse using BOTH data sources for comprehensive assessment:
   
   **A) Trading Data Analysis** - Perform deep analysis of trading patterns focusing on:
       a) **Probability Movement Patterns:**
        - Direction and magnitude of probability changes from start to current (calculate as probability percentages, not price percentages)
        - Probability stability vs volatility (derived from min/max price range converted to probabilities)
        - Trend consistency (steady probability increases/decreases vs erratic movement)
        - Current probability position relative to trading range
     
     b) **Market Confidence Indicators:**
        - Traded volume as indicator of market interest and confidence
        - Probability increasing (price shortening) with high volume (strong money backing)
        - Probability decreasing (price drifting) with low volume (lack of support)
        - Sudden probability movements indicating insider information or market shifts
     
     c) **Value Identification Signals:**
        - Horses whose current probability is near minimum traded probability (potential overlays)
        - Horses with consistent probability increases and strong volume (market confidence)
        - Horses with minimal probability movement but reasonable volume (stable assessment)
        - Horses showing probability decreases despite trading activity (potential value emerging)
     
     d) **Market Efficiency Factors:**
        - Comparison of start price vs current price movements
        - Volume distribution across different price levels
        - Market timing indicators (early vs late money)
        - Liquidity patterns and trading depth

   **B) Performance Data Analysis** - Analyze each horse's 'lastRacesDescription' field focusing on:
     
     a) **Performance Patterns:**
        - Consistency of competitive positions across recent races
        - Frequency of strong finishes ("led", "kept on well", "ran on", "finished strongly")
        - Recovery ability from setbacks and late race surge capability
        - Professional racing behavior and tactical racing
     
     b) **Positive Performance Indicators:**
        - Winning performances and competitive margins
        - Strong finishing kicks and sustained runs throughout races
        - Consistent involvement in race finish and competitive throughout duration
        - Evidence of improvement or progression in class/performance level
     
     c) **Negative Performance Indicators:**
        - Frequent mentions of "weakened", "outpaced", "struggling", "faded"
        - Jumping errors, hesitation, or technical issues
        - Physical problems (lameness, stumbling, breathing difficulties)
        - Behavioral problems (hanging, running green, refusing)
     
     d) **Contextual Performance Factors:**
        - Ground condition preferences and performance correlation
        - Equipment changes impact (blinkers, cheek-pieces, tongue ties)
        - Distance suitability and course preferences
        - Class level performance and recent form trends

   **C) Combined Assessment Integration:**
        - Cross-reference trading confidence with performance reliability
        - Identify horses where strong performance indicators align with positive trading signals
        - Flag discrepancies where trading data contradicts performance analysis
        - Weight trading signals more heavily for market efficiency, performance data for horse capability assessment

4. **Win Probability Assessment Based on Combined Data Analysis**
   - Assign win probabilities based on integrated trading pattern and performance analysis
   - Consider both market confidence indicators and actual racing capability
   - Weight factors for conservative approach:
     * **Trading Signals (60% weight)**: Strong volume with price shortening = higher probability
     * **Performance Quality (40% weight)**: Consistent competitive form and positive indicators
     * Combined positive signals = significantly higher confidence
     * Conflicting signals = moderate probability with risk assessment
     * Negative signals in both = lower probability assignment
   - Ensure probabilities are realistic and sum to approximately 100%
   - Document reasoning for each probability assignment with reference to both data sources

5. **Expected Value Calculations**
   - Calculate EV for backing each horse using formula:
     EV = (Win Probability × (Decimal Odds - 1)) - (1 - Win Probability)
   - Assign EV ratings based on calculated values:
     - **Excellent**: EV > +0.20
     - **Good**: EV +0.05 to +0.20
     - **Fair**: EV -0.05 to +0.05
     - **Poor**: EV -0.20 to -0.05
     - **Very Poor**: EV < -0.20
   - Identify horses with positive EV (value bets)
   - Identify horses with significantly negative EV (lay opportunities)
   - Rank all horses by EV from highest to lowest

6. **Market Favorite Identification and Combined Analysis**
   - Identify the market favorite (horse with lowest price/highest implied probability)
   - Analyze the favorite comprehensively using both data sources:
     * **Trading Analysis**: Volume support, price movement direction and magnitude, market confidence indicators, position within trading range
     * **Performance Analysis**: Recent form quality, consistency patterns, positive/negative indicators from race descriptions
     * **Combined Assessment**: How well trading confidence aligns with performance capability
   - Calculate the favorite's Expected Value and assign EV rating
   - Assess overall confidence level based on data source agreement/disagreement

7. **Conservative Selection Decision with Combined Data Analysis**
   - **PRIMARY CRITERIA**: Evaluate market favorite first using both data sources:
     a) The horse is the market favorite (lowest price)
     b) The favorite's EV rating is "Fair" or better (EV ≥ -0.05)
     c) The favorite shows positive or neutral trading signals (stable/shortening price with volume support)
     d) The favorite shows positive or neutral performance indicators (no major form concerns)
     e) Both trading volume and performance quality provide confidence in assessment
   
   - **ALTERNATIVE CRITERIA**: If favorite doesn't meet criteria, evaluate best alternative using combined assessment:
     a) Horse with highest positive EV that meets both trading and performance confidence criteria
     b) EV > +0.10 (minimum threshold for non-favorite selection)
     c) Win probability ≥ 15% based on combined trading and performance analysis
     d) Strong positive signals in BOTH trading data (shortening with volume) AND performance data (competitive form)
     e) No major negative indicators in either data source
   
   - **NO-BET CRITERIA**: If neither favorite nor alternatives meet conservative standards:
     a) Favorite has "Poor" or "Very Poor" EV rating (EV < -0.05)
     b) Favorite shows negative indicators in either trading or performance data
     c) No alternative selections meet minimum EV and combined confidence thresholds
     d) Market shows high inefficiency or contradictory signals between data sources

Format: Present the final analysis in clear, actionable format with emphasis on conservative risk management using trading data insights. Execute betting strategy ONLY when selection demonstrates acceptable value with strong trading confidence indicators.

Conservative Selection Criteria Priority:
1. **Market Favorite Evaluation** - Primary focus on lowest-risk market leader
2. **Trading Data Confidence** - Volume and price movement validation
3. **Minimum EV Standards** - Fair value threshold for favorite, higher for alternatives
4. **Risk Management** - Capital preservation over aggressive profit seeking
5. **Market Efficiency Assessment** - Clear value signals from trading patterns

**Strategy Selection Criteria:**
- **"Back trailing stop loss trading":** High confidence selections (favorite with Good+ EV or alternative with excellent signals)
- **"Trade 20% profit":** Moderate confidence selections (favorite with Fair EV or alternative with moderate signals)  
- **"Lay 10 Euro":** No acceptable selections meet conservative criteria

Trading Data Interpretation Guidelines for Conservative Approach:

**High Confidence Signals (Suitable for Conservative Betting):**
- Probability increasing (price shortening) with high traded volume
- Stable probability near maximum with consistent high volume
- Favorite showing neutral to positive trading signals with strong volume support

**Moderate Confidence Signals (Conditional Conservative Betting):**
- Minimal probability movement with steady moderate volume
- Slight probability increases with reasonable volume backing
- Market consensus indicators supporting current assessment

**Low Confidence Signals (Avoid or Lay):**
- Probability decreasing (price drifting) with declining volume
- Extreme volatility without volume justification
- Favorite showing negative trading signals despite market position

**Market Efficiency Indicators for Conservative Approach:**
- High volume favorites generally represent efficient pricing (good for conservative betting)
- Low volume markets may lack reliable price discovery (higher risk)
- Dramatic price movements require volume confirmation before betting

Note: This conservative approach prioritizes capital preservation and reliable value identification while leveraging trading data insights. The strategy acknowledges that favorites often represent the most reliable betting opportunities when supported by positive trading indicators and fair value, while providing systematic alternatives when the favorite fails to meet conservative standards.
