# Horse Racing Expected Value Analysis (R3) - Timeform & Racing Post Combined Edition

This prompt guides the analysis of horse racing data using both Timeform's professional racing analysis system and Racing Post's comprehensive racing data to calculate the Expected Value (EV) for each horse in an active Betfair market.

## Step 1: Retrieve Active Market Data

First, identify the active horse racing market using the `GetActiveBetfairMarket` tool. This will provide the `marketId` and a list of selections (horses) with their current odds.

## Step 2: Retrieve Detailed Horse Information

With the `marketId` from the previous step, use the `GetAllDataContextForBetfairMarket` tool with `dataContextNames` set to `['TimeformDataForHorsesInfo', 'RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo']`. This will return comprehensive analysis for each horse combining:

### Timeform Analysis (timeformHorseData field):
- `ratingStars`: Timeform's star rating system (1-5 stars, where 5 is highest quality)
- `horseWinnerLastTimeOut`: Boolean indicating if the horse won its last race
- `horseInForm`: Boolean indicating if the horse is currently in good form
- `horseBeatenFavouriteLTO`: Boolean indicating if the horse beat the favorite last time out
- `suitedByGoing`: Boolean indicating if current track conditions suit the horse
- `suitedByCourse`: Boolean indicating if the course suits the horse
- `suitedByDistance`: Boolean indicating if the race distance suits the horse
- `trainerInForm`: Boolean indicating if the trainer is currently in good form
- `trainerCourseRecord`: Boolean indicating if the trainer has a good record at this course
- `jockeyInForm`: Boolean indicating if the jockey is currently in good form
- `jockeyWonOnHorse`: Boolean indicating if the jockey has won on this horse before
- `timeformTopRated`: Boolean indicating if this is Timeform's top-rated horse in the race
- `timeformImprover`: Boolean indicating if Timeform expects improvement from this horse
- `timeformHorseInFocus`: Boolean indicating if this horse is featured in Timeform's focus

### Racing Post Analysis (racingpostHorseData field):
- `lastRacesDescriptions`: Array of recent race results, each with:
    - `beatenDistance`: Margin behind winner (numerical value, 0 for wins)
    - `lastRunInDays`: Days since last run (numerical value)
    - `position`: Finishing position (numerical value, 1 for wins, 0 for non-finishers)
    - `raceDescription`: Detailed text summary of race performance requiring semantic analysis
- `officialRating`: The horse's official handicap rating (if available)
- `rpRating`: Racing Post rating (if available)

**Important:** The `raceDescription` field contains rich textual data that requires semantic analysis to extract performance insights. Look for key phrases indicating:
- **Positive indicators**: "made all", "led", "won", "kept on well", "ran on", "always doing enough", "comfortably", "easily", "went clear", "good headway"
- **Negative indicators**: "weakened", "no extra", "always behind", "never dangerous", "eased", "pulled up", "tailed off", "detached"
- **Running style**: "prominent", "held up", "towards rear", "made all", "held up in last"
- **Trouble in running**: "hampered", "short of room", "denied clear run", "hung left/right", "stumbled", "slowly away"
- **Jockey comments**: Often in parentheses providing additional context

**Note:** Fields such as topspeedRating, recentForm, courseWins, distanceWins, goingWins, jockeyStats, trainerStats, draw, weight, age, and breeding are NOT present in RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo. Only the above fields are reliably available. Adjust all analysis and scoring logic to use only these fields.

## Step 3: Combined Data Analysis

Perform a comprehensive analysis using both data sources with the following enhanced scoring system:

### Base Rating Score (35% weight):
**Timeform Stars (15% weight):**
- **5 Stars**: 30 points
- **4 Stars**: 24 points
- **3 Stars**: 18 points
- **2 Stars**: 12 points
- **1 Star**: 6 points

**Racing Post Rating (20% weight):**
If `rpRating` is available:
    - RP Rating > 100: 40 points
    - RP Rating 90-100: 32 points
    - RP Rating 80-89: 24 points
    - RP Rating 70-79: 16 points
    - RP Rating < 70: 8 points
If not available, use 0 points.

### Form Analysis Score (30% weight):
**Timeform Form (15% weight):**
- `horseWinnerLastTimeOut`: +15 points
- `horseInForm`: +10 points
- `horseBeatenFavouriteLTO`: +5 points

**Racing Post Form (10% weight):**
Recent win (position == 1 in any of last 3 `lastRacesDescriptions`): +10 points
Recent place (position == 2 or 3 in any of last 3): +5 points
Recent run (`lastRunInDays` < 30 in any of last 3): +5 points
Long layoff (`lastRunInDays` > 100 in all last 3): -5 points

**Racing Post Semantic Analysis (additional 5% weight):**
Analyze `raceDescription` text for each of the last 3 runs:
- Strong performance language ("made all", "won easily", "kept on well", "went clear"): +3 points per race
- Positive finishing ("ran on", "stayed on", "kept on", "nearest finish"): +2 points per race
- Trouble in running that may excuse poor performance ("hampered", "denied clear run", "short of room"): +1 point per race
- Poor performance language ("weakened", "no extra", "never dangerous", "always behind"): -2 points per race
- Non-completion or serious issues ("pulled up", "unseated", "fell", "refused"): -3 points per race

### Course & Distance Suitability Score (20% weight):
**Timeform Suitability (10% weight):**
- `suitedByGoing`: +5 points
- `suitedByCourse`: +5 points
- `suitedByDistance`: +5 points

**Racing Post Statistics (10% weight):**
Not available in RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo. Do not use these factors.

### Connections Score (15% weight):
**Timeform Connections (8% weight):**
- `trainerInForm`: +4 points
- `trainerCourseRecord`: +3 points
- `jockeyInForm`: +3 points
- `jockeyWonOnHorse`: +2 points

**Racing Post Statistics (7% weight):**
Not available in RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo. Do not use these factors.

### Special Designations & Quality Factors (5% weight):
- `timeformTopRated`: +5 points
- `timeformImprover`: +3 points
- `timeformHorseInFocus`: +2 points

**Note:** Only Timeform special designations are available. Do not use `topspeedRating` or `age` from RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo.

**Total Combined Score**: Sum all applicable points (maximum possible: 255 points with semantic analysis)
**Important:** The maximum possible score may be lower in practice due to missing Racing Post fields. Adjust scoring and interpretation accordingly.

## Step 4: Calculate Implied Probability and Expected Value (EV)

1. **Estimate 'True' Probability:** Convert the Combined Score to a probability:
   - Normalize the Combined Score: `Normalized Score = (Combined Score / 255) * 100`
   - Calculate market share: For each horse, divide its Normalized Score by the sum of all horses' Normalized Scores
   - This gives you the estimated true probability for each horse

2. **Calculate Implied Probability:** For each horse, calculate the implied probability from their Betfair odds using the formula:
   `Implied Probability = 1 / Decimal Odds`

3. **Calculate Expected Value (EV):** For each horse, calculate the EV using the normalized formula:
   
   ```
   If True Probability >= Implied Probability:
       EV = ((True Probability - Implied Probability) / Implied Probability) * 100
   Else:
       EV = ((True Probability - Implied Probability) / True Probability) * 100
   
   Then apply bounds: EV = max(-100, min(100, EV))
   ```

## Step 5: Apply Combined Data Adjustments

Apply additional adjustments based on both data sources:

### Quality Multipliers:
- If `timeformTopRated` AND Racing Post Rating > 90: Multiply EV by 1.20
- If `timeformTopRated` OR Racing Post Rating > 100: Multiply EV by 1.15
- If `timeformImprover` AND recent improvement in semantic analysis: Multiply EV by 1.12
- If both `horseWinnerLastTimeOut` and `horseInForm` are true: Multiply EV by 1.08
- If strong semantic indicators in recent `raceDescription` ("made all", "went clear", "easily"): Multiply EV by 1.05

### Course/Distance/Going Synergy:
- If all suitability factors from Timeform are positive: Multiply EV by 1.10
- If semantic analysis shows consistent strong finishes: Multiply EV by 1.08

### Risk Adjustments:
- If none of the suitability factors are true: Multiply EV by 0.85
- If `ratingStars` â‰¤ 2 AND Racing Post Rating < 70: Multiply EV by 0.80
- If semantic analysis shows consistent poor performance language: Multiply EV by 0.80
- If long layoff (> 200 days in recent runs): Multiply EV by 0.90
- If poor recent form (no win/place in last 5 runs) AND negative semantic indicators: Multiply EV by 0.75

## Step 6: Present the Results

Present the analysis in a comprehensive table format with the following columns for each horse:
- Horse Name
- Timeform Stars
- Racing Post Rating (if available)
- Current Odds
- Combined Score (out of 255 max)
- Implied Probability
- Estimated "True" Probability
- Calculated EV (after adjustments)
- Key Indicators Summary (Timeform + Racing Post semantic analysis)
- Confidence Level (High/Medium/Low based on data agreement and semantic consistency)## Step 7: Execute Bet

Identify the horse with the highest positive EV that shows strong agreement between both data sources. Execute a bet if a horse meets the following enhanced criteria:

### Betting Criteria:
- **Positive EV**: Greater than +15% (higher threshold due to combined analysis)
- **Data Agreement**: Both Timeform and Racing Post semantic analysis should support the selection
- **Minimum Quality**: At least 3 Timeform stars OR RP Rating > 80 (if available)
- **Form Requirement**: Recent positive form from either source (recent win/place) AND positive semantic indicators
- **Odds Range**: Between 2.0 and 12.0

### Enhanced Quality Checks:
- Timeform indicators and Racing Post semantic analysis shouldn't contradict each other significantly
- Recent form should be supported by both quantitative data and qualitative race descriptions
- Look for consistency in running style and performance across recent races

### Execution:
If a horse meets these criteria, execute a bet using the `ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings` tool with the following parameters:
- `marketId`: The ID of the active market
- `selectionId`: The ID of the qualifying horse with the highest positive EV
- `strategyName`: "Bet 10 Euro"

If no horse meets these criteria, do not execute a bet and report "No qualifying combined analysis opportunity found."

## Step 8: Risk Management

### Enhanced Safeguards:
- Avoid betting on horses with odds greater than 12.0
- Do not bet if more than 2 horses have positive EV > 15% (market may be too competitive)
- Require data consensus: if Timeform and Racing Post semantic analysis strongly disagree, avoid the bet
- Consider market liquidity and betting exchange dynamics
- Factor in race conditions, weather, and last-minute changes

### Confidence Levels:
- **High Confidence**: Both sources strongly agree, multiple positive indicators, consistent semantic analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: Sources generally agree, some positive indicators, mostly consistent semantic patterns
- **Low Confidence**: Sources disagree, limited positive indicators, or conflicting semantic analysis

This combined Timeform and Racing Post approach leverages two of the most respected sources in horse racing analysis to identify value betting opportunities with enhanced accuracy and systematic risk management.
