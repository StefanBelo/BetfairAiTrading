# Horse Racing Silent OLBG EV Analysis with Automated Execution - Top 3 Favorites Only

## Silent Multi-Context EV Analysis with Strategy Execution on Top 3 Favorites Only

```
Task: Perform completely silent comprehensive Expected Value (EV) analysis for horse racing betting opportunities using both OLBG expert tips data and racing post performance data, select the best horse to back FROM THE TOP 3 FAVORITES BY PRICE ONLY, and execute a betting strategy automatically. This analysis combines expert tipster consensus interpretation, semantic performance analysis, and mathematical EV calculations to identify the optimal betting opportunity among the market favorites and automatically place the bet. ABSOLUTELY NO reports, tables, explanations, or intermediate outputs are generated - ONLY the final strategy execution confirmation message.

**CRITICAL RESTRICTION: Strategy execution is ONLY allowed on horses that are among the 3 favorites by current price. Horses ranked 4th or lower by price are excluded from strategy execution regardless of their EV or analysis results.**

Instructions:

1. **Market Data Retrieval**
   - Retrieve the active betfair market in BfexplorerApp using tool: GetActiveBetfairMarket
   - Save marketId for subsequent data retrieval
   - **Identify top 3 favorites by current price** (lowest prices = favorites)
   - No reports during data collection

2. **Multi-Context Data Collection**
   - Retrieve the data context with the name 'OlbgRaceTipsData' for the betfair market using tool: GetDataContextForBetfairMarket

   - SILENT data collection - no outputs during this phase

3. **Complete Analysis of ALL Horses**
   - **Analyze ALL horses in the race** - perform comprehensive EV analysis on every runner
   - **No filtering during analysis phase** - evaluate every horse regardless of price ranking
   - **Calculate EV for all horses** and rank by Expected Value from highest to lowest
   - **Identify top 3 favorites by current price** (3 horses with lowest current prices) for later filtering

        - Selections experiencing unexplained price movements
        - Volume patterns suggesting insider knowledge
        - Market efficiency gaps between true odds and traded prices

5. **Silent Combined Win Probability Assessment**
   - Synthesize insights from OLBG expert consensus, performance analysis, AND market dynamics data **FOR ALL HORSES**
   - Weight expert tips (40%), performance analysis (30%), and market data (30%) for probability assignment
   - Consider convergence and divergence between expert confidence, performance indicators, and market sentiment
   - Assign final win probabilities ensuring they sum to approximately 100%
   - Document reasoning for each probability assignment showing all three data sources **FOR EVERY RUNNER**

6. **Silent Expected Value Calculations**
   - Calculate EV for backing each horse using formula:
     EV = (Combined Win Probability × (Current Decimal Price - 1)) - (1 - Combined Win Probability)
   - Use CURRENT market prices (not start prices) for EV calculations **FOR ALL HORSES**
   - Market implied probability = 1 / Current Price for comparison with your assessed probability
   - Consider market efficiency factors from trading data (volume, price movements, steam activity)
   - Identify horses with positive EV (where your assessed probability > market implied probability)
   - Identify horses with significantly negative EV (potential lay opportunities)
   - **Apply market data weighting** - horses with strong volume and positive price movements get additional confidence
   - Rank all horses by EV from highest to lowest **ACROSS ALL RUNNERS**
   - **Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%** across all selections

7. **Execution Decision with Favorites Filter**
   - **After complete analysis of ALL horses:** Identify the horse with highest Expected Value across entire field
   - **Apply favorites constraint at decision point:** Check if the best EV horse is among top 3 favorites by current price
   - **If best EV horse is among top 3 favorites:** Proceed with strategy execution on that horse
   - **If best EV horse is NOT among top 3 favorites:** Find the best EV horse that IS among top 3 favorites
   - **If no horse among top 3 favorites meets execution criteria:** Output "No suitable favorite found for execution"
   - **Strategy selection based on best qualifying horse:**
     1. Positive Expected Value (EV > 0)
     2. Convergence between expert consensus and performance indicators
     3. Strong signals from both data sources
     4. Reasonable win probability for betting (typically >15%) or trading opportunity (8-15%)
     5. Manageable risk profile
     6. Clear market mispricing signals based on combined analysis

8. **Silent Strategy Selection (Best EV Horse Among Top 3 Favorites)**
   - **Strategy execution only on the qualifying horse with best metrics:**

       - Positive Expected Value (EV > 0.1)
       - Win probability ≥ 15%
       - Strong convergence between expert consensus, performance indicators, AND market sentiment
       - Strong expert backing (multiple NAPs or high tipster count) with good recent form AND positive market signals

     * **Use "Trade 20% profit" strategy** when qualifying selection meets trading criteria:
       - Moderate Expected Value (EV > 0 but < 0.1)
       - Win probability between 8-15%
       - Mixed signals between expert tips, performance data, AND market movements
       - Moderate expert backing with some performance concerns OR conflicting market signals
       - Strategy takes exactly 20% profit from the opening back bet when available
   - **If best EV horse is not among top 3 favorites AND no top 3 favorite meets execution criteria:** Output "No suitable favorite found for execution"

9. **JSON Data Storage (Silent)**
   - Generate comprehensive JSON containing **ALL HORSES** with detailed analysis data from all three sources

10. **Automated Strategy Execution (Best EV Horse if Among Top 3 Favorites)**
    - Store comprehensive analysis JSON data **FOR ALL HORSES** using tool: SetAIAgentDataContextForBetfairMarket with dataContextName "HorseRacingOlbgEVAnalysisResults"
    - **Decision Logic:**
      1. **Identify horse with highest EV across ALL horses in race**
      2. **Check if this horse is among top 3 favorites by current price**
      3. **If YES:** Execute strategy on this horse
      4. **If NO:** Find horse with highest EV that IS among top 3 favorites
      5. **If no top 3 favorite meets execution criteria:** Output "No suitable favorite found for execution"
    - **Strategy Execution (only if qualifying horse found):**
      - Activate the selected horse's market and selection using tool: ActivateBetfairMarketSelection
      - Execute the appropriate strategy using tool: ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings
      - Confirm strategy execution with minimal output
    - **Note: Analysis includes ALL horses, but execution requires best horse to be among top 3 favorites**

11. **Final Confirmation ONLY**
    - If strategy executed: "Strategy executed: [Strategy Name] on [Horse Name] at [Price] odds"
    - If no execution: "No suitable favorite found for execution"
    - **ABSOLUTELY NO detailed analysis reports, tables, explanations, or intermediate outputs**
    - **ONLY the single line execution confirmation or no-execution message**

**Favorites Filter Logic:**
1. **Analyze ALL horses comprehensively** - no filtering during analysis phase
2. **Rank all horses by Expected Value** (highest to lowest across entire field)
3. **Separately rank all horses by current price** (ascending) - lowest price = 1st favorite, second lowest = 2nd favorite, third lowest = 3rd favorite
4. **Execution Decision:** 
   - **First choice:** Horse with highest EV if it's among top 3 favorites
   - **Second choice:** Horse with highest EV that IS among top 3 favorites
   - **No execution:** If no top 3 favorite meets execution criteria
