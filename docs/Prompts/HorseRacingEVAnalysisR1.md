# Horse Racing Expected Value Analysis (R1)

This prompt guides the analysis of horse racing data to calculate the Expected Value (EV) for each horse in an active Betfair market.

## Step 1: Retrieve Active Market Data

First, identify the active horse racing market using the `GetActiveBetfairMarket` tool. This will provide the `marketId` and a list of selections (horses) with their current odds.

## Step 2: Retrieve Detailed Horse Information

With the `marketId` from the previous step, use the `GetAllDataContextForBetfairMarket` tool with `dataContextNames` set to `['RacingpostDataForHorsesInfo']`. This will return detailed information for each horse in the `racingpostHorseData` field, including:
  - `lastRacesDescriptions`: Array of recent races, each with `beatenDistance`, `lastRunInDays`, `position`, and `raceDescription`.
  - `officialRating`: Official handicap rating.
  - `rpRating`: Racing Post rating.

## Step 3: Analyze Last Races Data

For each horse, perform a semantic analysis of the `lastRacesDescriptions` array in the `racingpostHorseData` field. The goal is to quantify the horse's recent performance. Consider the following factors from the structured data:

*   **Finishing Position (`position`)**: Winning (1st), placing (2nd, 3rd), or unplaced.
*   **Beaten Distance (`beatenDistance`)**: How far the horse was from the winner. A smaller distance is better.
*   **Semantic Race Analysis (`raceDescription`)**: For each race, analyze the narrative for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment and extract key performance factors.
*   **Jockey/Trainer Comments**: Note any specific comments in the `raceDescription` (e.g., "jockey said gelding ran too free" or "denied a clear run").
*   **Recency (`lastRunInDays`)**: Give more weight to more recent races (smaller value).
*   **Official Ratings**: Use `officialRating` and `rpRating` for additional context in your assessment.

## Step 4: Calculate Implied Probability and Expected Value (EV)

1.  **Estimate 'True' Probability:** Based on your analysis from Step 3, assign a "true" probability of winning for each horse. This is a subjective assessment based on the qualitative data. You might create a scoring system (e.g., -10 to +10) for each race description and average them, then normalize to get a probability distribution across all horses.

2.  **Calculate Implied Probability:** For each horse, calculate the implied probability from their Betfair odds using the formula:
    `Implied Probability = 1 / Decimal Odds`

3.  **Calculate Expected Value (EV):** For each horse, calculate the EV using the formula:
    `EV = (True Probability * (Decimal Odds - 1)) - (1 - True Probability)`

## Step 5: Present the Results

Present the analysis in a clear table format with the following columns for each horse:
*   Horse Name
*   Current Odds
*   Implied Probability
*   Your Estimated "True" Probability
*   Calculated EV
*   Brief Reasoning Summary.

The final output should be a ranked list of horses by their EV, from highest to lowest.

## Step 6: Execute Bet

Identify the horse with the highest positive EV. If a horse with a positive EV exists **and** its Estimated "True" Probability is greater than 10%, execute a bet on that horse using the `ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings` tool. Use the following parameters:

*   `marketId`: The ID of the active market.
*   `selectionId`: The ID of the horse with the highest positive EV.
*   `strategyName`: "Bet 10 Euro"

If no horse meets these criteria, do not execute a bet.
