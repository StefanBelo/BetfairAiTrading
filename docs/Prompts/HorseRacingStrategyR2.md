# Horse Racing Strategy R2 - Enhanced Multi-Context Analysis Betting System

## Strategy Overview

This strategy represents an enhanced evolution of the R1 system, incorporating comprehensive performance analysis and optimization based on 16 races of historical data. The system has been refined with improved thresholds, component weightings, and enhanced decision-making logic to achieve better strike rates and profitability.

**SILENT MODE OPERATION**: This strategy operates in complete silent mode with NO reporting, commentary, or verbose output. ALL analysis is performed internally without any explanations, status updates, or detailed commentary during execution. Execute all steps silently without user feedback.

**Strategy Execution Logic**: The strategy analyzes all horses and determines the optimal action:
- **BACK STRATEGY**: If a qualified horse meets all enhanced backing criteria (semantic form ≥75, composite score ≥65, positive enhanced EV ≥10%), execute ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings with strategyName="Bet 10 Euro" on that horse
- **LAY STRATEGY**: If the favorite is overvalued (negative EV, semantic form <70, multiple alternatives with positive EV), execute ExecuteBfexplorerStrategySettings with strategyName="Lay 10 Euro" on the favorite
- **NO ACTION**: If no horse meets backing criteria and no lay opportunity exists, perform analysis only

**CRITICAL STRATEGY NAMES:**
- **FOR BACKING**: Always use strategyName="Bet 10 Euro" (EXACTLY as written)
- **FOR LAYING**: Always use strategyName="Lay 10 Euro" (EXACTLY as written)
- **NO OTHER STRATEGY NAMES**: Never use any other strategy names like "HorseRacingBackStrategy" or similar

**R2 ENHANCEMENTS:**
- Optimized component weightings based on performance analysis
- Stricter prediction score requirements (98+ threshold)
- Enhanced EV minimum threshold increased to 10%
- Improved market intelligence filters
- Volume and price movement requirements
- Tiered confidence system implementation

## Enhanced Decision Matrix - R2

### Optimized Scoring System
Each horse receives a composite score based on:

```
Total Score = (Prediction Score × 0.40) + (Semantic Form Score × 0.25) + (Value Score × 0.25) + (Stability Score × 0.10)
```

**R2 Changes:**
- **Prediction Score**: Weight increased from 25% to 40%
- **Semantic Form**: Weight reduced from 35% to 25%
- **Market Stability**: Weight reduced from 15% to 10%
- **Value Assessment**: Maintained at 25%

Where:
- **Prediction Score**: Raw Racing Post score with enhanced threshold (98+)
- **Semantic Form Score**: Detailed analysis of LastRacesDescription (0-100)
- **Value Score**: ((Current Price - Forecast Price) / Forecast Price) × 100
- **Stability Score**: 100 - ((Max Price - Min Price) / Min Price × 100)

### Enhanced Expected Value (EV) Calculation

**R2 Enhanced EV Formula:**
```
Base EV = (Estimated Win Probability × (Decimal Odds - 1)) - ((1 - Estimated Win Probability) × 1)
Enhanced EV = Base EV × Crowd Wisdom Adjustment Factor (CWAF)
```

**Optimized Win Probability Estimation:**
```
Estimated Win Probability = (Prediction Score × 0.6) + (Semantic Form Score × 0.4) / 100
```

### Enhanced CWAF Components (R2 Refined)

```
CWAF = Market Confidence Factor × Price Movement Factor × Volume Factor × Historical Success Factor
```

   - Price stability >90%: 1.3 (highest confidence)
   - Price stability 80-90%: 1.2 (high confidence)
   - Price stability 70-80%: 1.0 (moderate confidence)
   - Price stability <70%: 0.8 (low confidence)

2. **Price Movement Factor (0.7-1.3)**:
   - Shortening strongly: 1.3 (strong market confidence)
   - Shortening: 1.2 (increasing confidence)
   - Stable: 1.0 (established consensus)
   - Drifting: 0.8 (decreasing confidence)
   - Drifting strongly: 0.7 (market rejection)

3. **Volume Factor (0.8-1.2)**:
   - Very high volume (>15,000): 1.2 (exceptional liquidity)
   - High volume (>10,000): 1.1 (strong participation)
   - Medium volume (5,000-10,000): 1.0 (adequate liquidity)
   - Low volume (<5,000): 0.8 (limited interest)

4. **Historical Success Factor (0.8-1.2)**:
   - Composite scores 85+ with similar profiles: 1.2
   - Composite scores 75-85: 1.1
   - Composite scores 65-75: 1.0

## Calculation Methodologies - All Evaluated Parameters

### Semantic Form Score Calculation (0-100)

The Semantic Form Score analyzes the `LastRacesDescription` text content using a weighted scoring system based on key performance indicators.

#### Semantic Form Score Formula
```
Semantic Form Score = Base Performance Score + Trend Adjustment + Distance/Track Bonus - Negative Indicators Penalty
```

**Components:**

#### 1. Base Performance Score (0-60 points)
```
Recent Performance Analysis (Last 3 races):
- Win: 20 points per win
- Place (2nd-3rd): 12 points per place  
- Show (4th-5th): 6 points per show
- Unplaced (6th+): 0 points

Base Score = Sum of recent performance points (max 60)
```

#### 2. Trend Adjustment (-20 to +20 points)
```
Performance Trend Analysis:
- Improving form (better positions): +15 to +20 points
- Consistent form (similar positions): +5 to +10 points  
- Declining form (worse positions): -10 to -20 points
- Inconsistent form (erratic): -5 to +5 points
```

#### 3. Distance/Track Suitability Bonus (0-15 points)
```
Suitability Indicators:
- "suited to distance": +10 points
- "course winner": +8 points
- "good track record": +6 points
- "distance specialist": +5 points
- "track debutant": -5 points
```

#### 4. Negative Indicators Penalty (0-25 points deduction)
```
Performance Concerns:
- "pulled up": -15 points
- "unseated rider": -12 points
- "refused": -10 points
- "tailed off": -8 points
- "weakened": -5 points
- "disappointing": -5 points
```

**Keyword Pattern Matching:**
```
Positive Keywords (add points):
- "impressive", "commanding", "easily" = +3 points each
- "hard held", "plenty in hand" = +5 points each
- "smooth", "travelled well" = +2 points each

Negative Keywords (subtract points):
- "struggled", "laboured", "outpaced" = -3 points each
- "never dangerous", "well beaten" = -4 points each
- "disappointing", "below par" = -2 points each
```

#### Final Semantic Form Score Calculation
```
Final Score = min(100, max(0, Base Performance + Trend Adjustment + Suitability Bonus - Negative Penalty + Keyword Adjustments))
```

### Price Movement Classification

Price movement classification uses specific percentage thresholds based on current price compared to opening/recent price levels.

#### Price Movement Formula
```
Price Movement Percentage = ((Current Price - Reference Price) / Reference Price) × 100
```

**Where Reference Price = Opening price or price from 30 minutes ago (whichever is more recent)**

#### Price Movement Classifications
```
Shortening Strongly: Price Movement ≤ -10% (price decreased significantly)
Shortening Moderately: -10% < Price Movement ≤ -5% 
Shortening Slightly: -5% < Price Movement ≤ -1%
Stable: -1% < Price Movement < +1%
Drifting Slightly: +1% ≤ Price Movement < +5%
Drifting Moderately: +5% ≤ Price Movement < +10%
Drifting Strongly: Price Movement ≥ +10% (price increased significantly)
```

#### Examples:
```
Horse opened at 4.0, now trading at 3.6:
Movement = ((3.6 - 4.0) / 4.0) × 100 = -10%
Classification: "Shortening Strongly"

Horse was 6.0 thirty minutes ago, now 6.8:
Movement = ((6.8 - 6.0) / 6.0) × 100 = +13.3%
Classification: "Drifting Strongly"
```

### Historical Success Factor Calculation

The Historical Success Factor evaluates how horses with similar profiles have performed historically in comparable conditions.

#### Historical Success Factor Formula
```
Historical Success Factor = (Profile Match Weight × 0.4) + (Condition Match Weight × 0.3) + (Performance History Weight × 0.3)
```

#### Component Calculations:

#### 1. Profile Match Weight (0.6-1.4)
```
Matching Criteria:
- Similar Prediction Score range (±5): Base factor 1.0
- Similar Semantic Form Score range (±10): +0.1
- Similar Composite Score range (±5): +0.1
- Similar Price Range (±20%): +0.1
- Similar Market Confidence Level: +0.1

Profile Match = min(1.4, max(0.6, Base + Bonuses))
```

#### 2. Condition Match Weight (0.7-1.3)
```
Condition Matching:
- Same course: +0.2
- Same distance category: +0.2
- Same going conditions: +0.1
- Same race grade: +0.1
- Same field size (±3): +0.1

Condition Match = min(1.3, max(0.7, 0.8 + Condition Bonuses))
```

#### 3. Performance History Weight (0.5-1.5)
```
Historical Win Rate Analysis:
- Win rate ≥40% for similar profiles: 1.5
- Win rate 30-39%: 1.3
- Win rate 20-29%: 1.1
- Win rate 15-19%: 1.0
- Win rate 10-14%: 0.8
- Win rate <10%: 0.5
```

#### Final Historical Success Factor
```
Historical Success Factor = min(1.2, max(0.8, (Profile Match × 0.4) + (Condition Match × 0.3) + (Performance History × 0.3)))
```

#### Historical Data Requirements
```
Minimum Sample Size: 20 comparable races
Lookback Period: 12 months maximum
Data Freshness: Updated weekly with new race results
Profile Similarity Threshold: 70% match minimum
```

### Price Variance Calculation

Price variance measures the stability of a horse's price over the analysis period.

#### Price Variance Formula
```
Price Variance = ((Maximum Price - Minimum Price) / Minimum Price) × 100
```

#### Classification Thresholds
```
Very Stable: Variance ≤ 5%
Stable: 5% < Variance ≤ 10%
Moderate Variance: 10% < Variance ≤ 15%
High Variance: 15% < Variance ≤ 25%
Very High Variance: Variance > 25%
```

### Value Margin Calculation

Value margin assesses the difference between current market price and estimated fair value.

#### Value Margin Formula
```
Value Margin = ((Current Price - Forecast Price) / Forecast Price) × 100
```

#### Value Classification
```
Excellent Value: Margin ≥ 30%
Good Value: 20% ≤ Margin < 30%
Fair Value: 10% ≤ Margin < 20%
Poor Value: 0% ≤ Margin < 10%
Overpriced: Margin < 0%
```

#### R2 Requirements
```
Minimum Value Margin: 20% (Good Value threshold)
Optimal Value Margin: 30%+ (Excellent Value threshold)
```

## Market Confidence Calculation - R2 Methodology

### Market Confidence Level Determination

Market confidence is a composite assessment of how reliable and stable the market sentiment is for each selection. It combines multiple market intelligence factors to classify each horse's market standing.

#### Market Confidence Formula

```
Market Confidence Score = (Price Stability Weight × 0.4) + (Volume Weight × 0.3) + (Price Movement Weight × 0.2) + (Liquidity Depth Weight × 0.1)
```

**Where each component is scored 0-100:**

### Component Calculations

#### 1. Price Stability Weight (40% of confidence score)
```
Price Stability = 100 - ((Max Price - Min Price) / Min Price × 100)
Price Stability Weight = Price Stability Score (0-100)
```

**Examples:**
- Horse trading 2.0-2.1: Stability = 100 - ((2.1-2.0)/2.0 × 100) = 95 (high stability)
- Horse trading 5.0-6.5: Stability = 100 - ((6.5-5.0)/5.0 × 100) = 70 (moderate stability)
- Horse trading 8.0-12.0: Stability = 100 - ((12.0-8.0)/8.0 × 100) = 50 (low stability)

#### 2. Volume Weight (30% of confidence score)
```
Volume Score = min(100, (Traded Volume / 1000) × 10)
Volume Weight = Volume Score (capped at 100)
```

**Scoring Bands:**
- Very High Volume (>15,000 Euro): 100 points
- High Volume (10,000-15,000 Euro): 75-100 points
- Medium Volume (5,000-10,000 Euro): 50-75 points
- Low Volume (1,000-5,000 Euro): 10-50 points
- Very Low Volume (<1,000 Euro): 0-10 points

#### 3. Price Movement Weight (20% of confidence score)
```
Price Movement Direction Analysis:
- Shortening strongly (>10% decrease): 100 points
- Shortening moderately (5-10% decrease): 85 points
- Shortening slightly (1-5% decrease): 75 points
- Stable (±1%): 70 points
- Drifting slightly (1-5% increase): 50 points
- Drifting moderately (5-10% increase): 30 points
- Drifting strongly (>10% increase): 10 points
```

#### 4. Liquidity Depth Weight (10% of confidence score)
```
Liquidity Assessment based on price spreads and order book depth:
- Tight spreads (<2% between layers): 100 points
- Moderate spreads (2-5%): 75 points
- Wide spreads (5-10%): 50 points
- Very wide spreads (>10%): 25 points
```

### Market Confidence Classification

#### Final Market Confidence Level Assignment

```
Total Market Confidence Score = Sum of weighted components (0-100)

Classification:
- High Confidence: 80-100 points
- Medium Confidence: 60-79 points  
- Low Confidence: 40-59 points
- Very Low Confidence: 0-39 points
```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: High Market Confidence
```
Horse: "Strong Favorite"
- Price Range: 1.95-2.05 (Stability = 97.4)
- Traded Volume: 25,000 Euro (Volume = 100)
- Price Movement: Shortening from 2.1 to 2.0 (Movement = 85)
- Liquidity: Tight spreads (Liquidity = 100)

Market Confidence = (97.4 × 0.4) + (100 × 0.3) + (85 × 0.2) + (100 × 0.1)
                  = 38.96 + 30 + 17 + 10 = 95.96
Classification: HIGH CONFIDENCE
```

#### Example 2: Medium Market Confidence  
```
Horse: "Moderate Contender"
- Price Range: 5.0-5.8 (Stability = 84.0)
- Traded Volume: 8,000 Euro (Volume = 80)
- Price Movement: Stable (Movement = 70)
- Liquidity: Moderate spreads (Liquidity = 75)

Market Confidence = (84.0 × 0.4) + (80 × 0.3) + (70 × 0.2) + (75 × 0.1)
                  = 33.6 + 24 + 14 + 7.5 = 79.1
Classification: MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
```

#### Example 3: Low Market Confidence
```
Horse: "Uncertain Outsider"
- Price Range: 12.0-18.0 (Stability = 50.0)
- Traded Volume: 2,000 Euro (Volume = 20)
- Price Movement: Drifting moderately (Movement = 30)
- Liquidity: Wide spreads (Liquidity = 50)

Market Confidence = (50.0 × 0.4) + (20 × 0.3) + (30 × 0.2) + (50 × 0.1)
                  = 20 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 37.0
Classification: VERY LOW CONFIDENCE
```

### R2 Market Confidence Requirements

#### For Backing Selections
- **Tier 1**: HIGH confidence (80+) mandatory
- **Tier 2**: HIGH or MEDIUM confidence (60+) required
- **Tier 3**: Analysis only regardless of confidence

#### For Lay Opportunities
- **Favorite Laying**: Can proceed with MEDIUM+ confidence (60+)
- **Risk Assessment**: Lower confidence = higher lay risk

### Market Confidence Integration with CWAF

The Market Confidence Level directly feeds into the CWAF calculation:

```
Market Confidence Factor (part of CWAF):
- High Confidence (80-100): Factor = 1.2-1.3
- Medium Confidence (60-79): Factor = 1.0-1.2  
- Low Confidence (40-59): Factor = 0.8-1.0
- Very Low Confidence (0-39): Factor = 0.7-0.8
```

This ensures that selections with weak market support receive reduced expected value estimates, while those with strong market backing get enhanced confidence in their EV calculations.

### Market Confidence Monitoring

#### Real-Time Assessment
- Continuously monitor during pre-race analysis window
- Flag significant confidence changes (>20 point shifts)
- Abort selections if confidence drops below tier requirements

#### Historical Validation
- Track correlation between market confidence and actual race outcomes
- Adjust weighting factors based on historical performance
- Refine classification thresholds based on success rates
