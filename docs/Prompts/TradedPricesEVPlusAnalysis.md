             - `name` (string, e.g. "Four Adaay")
             - `data.tradedPricesData` (object):
                - `startPrice` (number) ‚Äî opening price for this analysis window
                - `endPrice` (number) ‚Äî latest/current price (use as Current Odds)
                - `minPrice` (number) ‚Äî lowest price during period
                - `maxPrice` (number) ‚Äî highest price during period
                - `tradedVolume` (number) ‚Äî total matched volume for the selection
                - `backRatio` (number) ‚Äî proportion of volume that was back bets (0.0-1.0)
                - `layRatio` (number) ‚Äî proportion of volume that was lay bets (0.0-1.0)
             - `data.racingpostHorseData` (object, if available for Horse Racing):
                - `officialRating` (number) ‚Äî official handicap rating
                - `rpRating` (number) ‚Äî Racing Post rating
                - `lastRacesDescriptions` (array) ‚Äî detailed race history with distances beaten, days since, positions, etc.

   **Critical parsing notes:**
   - Current Odds = `data.tradedPricesData.endPrice`
   - Opening Price = `data.tradedPricesData.startPrice`
   - BackRatio = `data.tradedPricesData.backRatio` (already calculated as decimal 0.0-1.0)
   - LayRatio = `data.tradedPricesData.layRatio` (already calculated as decimal 0.0-1.0)
   - Total Volume = `data.tradedPricesData.tradedVolume`
   - Back Volume = BackRatio √ó TotalVolume
   - Lay Volume = LayRatio √ó TotalVolume
   - Price Range = maxPrice - minPrice
   - Price Movement = (endPrice - startPrice) / startPrice * 100 (percentage change)

3. **STEP 3 - CALCULATE EV METRICS (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY):**
   For each selection, calculate:
   - Current implied probability = 1 / decimal_odds
   - BackRatio = data.tradedPricesData.backRatio (direct field, 0.0-1.0)
   - LayRatio = data.tradedPricesData.layRatio (direct field, 0.0-1.0)
   - Back volume = BackRatio √ó tradedVolume
   - Lay volume = LayRatio √ó tradedVolume
   - Market sentiment score = BackRatio - LayRatio (range: -1.0 to +1.0)
   - Price momentum = (endPrice - startPrice) / startPrice * 100 (percentage change)
   - Price volatility = (maxPrice - minPrice) / endPrice * 100 (percentage volatility)
   - Volume-weighted sentiment = sentiment_score √ó log(1 + tradedVolume/1000) (adjust for volume significance)
   - Liquidity factor = min(1.0, tradedVolume / 5000) (normalize high volume impact)
   - Expected Value = sentiment_score √ó liquidity_factor - market_overround_adjustment
   - Risk-adjusted EV = EV √ó (1 - price_volatility/100) √ó confidence_score

   **Enhanced EV Calculation Formula:**
   ```
   Base_EV = (BackRatio - 0.5) √ó 2  // Convert to -1 to +1 scale
   Volume_Weight = log(1 + TradedVolume / 1000) / 5  // Logarithmic volume scaling
   Momentum_Factor = tanh(Price_Momentum / 10)  // Bounded momentum impact
   Volatility_Penalty = 1 - (Price_Volatility / 100)  // Reduce EV for high volatility
   
   Final_EV = Base_EV √ó Volume_Weight √ó Momentum_Factor √ó Volatility_Penalty
   ```

4. **STEP 4 - ANALYZE MARKET EFFICIENCY (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY):**
   - Calculate total market overround
   - Identify price discrepancies
   - Assess liquidity depth per selection
   - Determine market confidence levels

5. **STEP 5 - GENERATE RESULTS TABLE (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY):**
   Display results in this EXACT format:

   | Selection | Current Odds | Impl. Prob % | EV % | Form Analysis |
   |-----------|--------------|--------------|------|---------------|
   | [Auto-populate from data] | [endPrice] | [1/endPrice*100] | [calculated EV] | [Semantic form summary] |

   **Enhanced Analysis Columns:**
   - **Current Odds**: data.tradedPricesData.endPrice
   - **Impl. Prob %**: (1/endPrice) √ó 100, rounded to 1 decimal
   - **EV %**: Final calculated EV as percentage, 2 decimal places
   - **Form Analysis**: Semantic analysis of recent form from lastRacesDescriptions (last 3-5 races)
     - Extract key performance patterns from raceDescription text
     - Identify strengths: "strong finisher", "travels well", "good jumper"
     - Identify weaknesses: "weakened", "mistake prone", "hangs left/right"
     - Note recent wins/places and consistency patterns
     - Summarize in 2-3 concise phrases maximum

   **Additional Summary Tables:**

   **üìä MARKET OVERVIEW:**

   | Most Backed | [highest backRatio selection] |
   | Most Laid | [highest layRatio selection] |
   | Price Movers | [biggest price changes] |

6. **STEP 6 - PROVIDE STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY):**
   
   **For Horse Racing Markets, include Racing Post Analysis:**
   - Extract `data.racingpostHorseData.officialRating` and `rpRating`
   - Analyze recent form from `lastRacesDescriptions` (last 3-5 races)
   - **Semantic Form Analysis Process:**
     * Parse `raceDescription` text for performance indicators
     * Identify positive patterns: "led", "kept on", "ran on", "strong challenge", "going well"
     * Identify negative patterns: "weakened", "mistake", "unseated", "pulled up", "tailed off"
     * Note running style: "prominent", "held up", "towards rear", "made all"
     * Extract recent placings and beaten distances
     * Summarize strengths/weaknesses in concise phrases
   - Calculate form metrics: average beaten distance, consistency, class trends
   - Cross-reference ratings with current odds for value identification

   **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Identify TOP 3 positive EV opportunities with supporting evidence
   - List selections to AVOID (negative EV) with reasoning
   - Recommend optimal bet sizing using Kelly criterion: f* = (bp-q)/b where b=odds-1, p=implied_prob, q=1-p
   - Suggest entry/exit timing based on price momentum and volume trends
   - Provide risk management advice including stop-loss levels
   - Include form-based insights for horse racing (if applicable)

   **Risk Assessment Matrix:**
   | Selection | EV Score | Risk Level | Recommended Stake | Form Summary |
   |-----------|----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
   | [Top picks] | [EV%] | [Low/Med/High] | [Kelly %] | [Key form points] |
