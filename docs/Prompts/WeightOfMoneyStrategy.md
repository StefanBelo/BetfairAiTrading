# Weight of Money Strategy Execution Prompt

## Objective
Analyze Betfair market weight of money data, identify the highest confidence prediction, and automatically execute the appropriate trading strategy based on the prediction direction.

### Automatic Strategy Selection:
- **Shorten Prediction (⬇️)**: Execute "Back Trade" strategy on highest confidence selection
- **Drift Prediction (⬆️)**: Execute "Lay Trade" strategy on highest confidence selection
- **Minimum Confidence**: Only execute if confidence ≥ 40%
- **Market Position Filter**: Only execute on selections among the 3 favorites (lowest odds)

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Points to Examine
- **Average Back Traded Price & Volume**: Shows where money has been backing the selection
- **Average Lay Traded Price & Volume**: Shows where money has been laying against the selection
- **Current Market Price**: The present best back price available
- **Traded Prices History**: Complete trading history showing volume at each price level
  - **NEW**: Provides detailed view of where all money has traded
  - **Price Distribution**: Shows concentration of trading activity across price ranges
  - **Volume Patterns**: Identifies price levels with highest trading interest
- **Offered Prices Ladder**: Distribution of available liquidity at different price levels
  - **CRITICAL**: BetType 1 (Back) volume = Money available to LAY (lay offers)
  - **CRITICAL**: BetType 2 (Lay) volume = Money available to BACK (back offers)
- **Volume Imbalance**: Compare backing vs laying volumes to identify market sentiment

### 2. Key Indicators for Price Movement

#### Price Direction Signals:
- **Current vs Historical Averages**: If current price significantly differs from traded averages
- **Traded Price Distribution**: Analysis of where the bulk of trading volume has occurred
  - **High Volume Zones**: Price levels with significant trading activity indicate strong support/resistance
  - **Price Migration**: Movement of trading volume from higher to lower prices (or vice versa)
  - **Volume Concentration**: Whether trading is concentrated at few price levels or distributed
- **Volume Imbalance**: Heavy backing suggests price shortening, heavy laying suggests drifting
- **Liquidity Distribution**: Where the weight of money is positioned on the price ladder
  - **Backing Pressure**: High volume at BetType 2 (Lay) prices = Strong backing interest
  - **Laying Pressure**: High volume at BetType 1 (Back) prices = Strong laying interest

#### Strength Indicators:
- **Volume Magnitude**: Higher volumes indicate stronger signals
- **Price Deviation**: Larger gaps between current and average prices suggest bigger moves
- **Traded Volume Distribution**: How trading volume is spread across price levels
  - **Concentrated Trading**: Most volume at few price levels suggests strong conviction
  - **Distributed Trading**: Volume spread across many prices suggests uncertainty
  - **Volume Weighted Average**: Price weighted by actual trading volumes
- **Market Efficiency**: Consistent patterns across multiple price levels

### 3. Movement Prediction Categories

#### Strong Movement Expected (>15% price change):
- Large volume imbalance (>50% difference)
- Current price >20% away from traded averages
- Clear directional bias in offered prices

#### Moderate Movement Expected (5-15% price change):
- Moderate volume imbalance (20-50% difference)
- Current price 10-20% away from traded averages
- Some directional bias visible

#### Stable/Minor Movement (<5% price change):
- Balanced volumes
- Current price within 10% of traded averages
- Well-distributed liquidity

### 4. Risk Factors to Consider
- **Market Volatility**: Horse racing markets can be highly volatile
- **Time to Event**: Closer to start time = more reliable signals
- **External Factors**: Weather, jockey changes, market rumors
- **Liquidity Depth**: Thin markets more susceptible to manipulation

### 5. Favorites Filter Rationale
- **Liquidity Focus**: The 3 favorites typically have the highest liquidity and most reliable price movements
- **Market Efficiency**: Favorites receive the most attention and analysis, making weight of money signals more meaningful
- **Risk Management**: Outsiders can have erratic price movements unrelated to fundamental value
- **Strategy Effectiveness**: Trading strategies work best on selections with consistent market participation
- **Execution Quality**: Better fills and tighter spreads available on favorites

## CRITICAL: Understanding BetType in Offered Prices

**BetType Interpretation (ESSENTIAL):**
- **BetType 1 (Back)**: Volume represents money available to LAY
  - These are lay offers - people willing to lay at these prices
  - High volume here = Strong laying interest/pressure
- **BetType 2 (Lay)**: Volume represents money available to BACK  
  - These are back offers - people willing to back at these prices
  - High volume here = Strong backing interest/pressure

**Market Pressure Analysis:**
- **Backing Pressure**: High BetType 2 volumes (back offers) indicate demand to back
- **Laying Pressure**: High BetType 1 volumes (lay offers) indicate willingness to lay
- **Price Movement**: 
  - Strong backing pressure (high BetType 2 volumes) → Odds likely to shorten
  - Strong laying pressure (high BetType 1 volumes) → Odds likely to drift

## NEW: Traded Prices Analysis Framework

### Understanding Traded Prices Data
The **tradedPrices** array provides complete trading history showing:
- **Price**: Each price level where trading occurred
- **Volume**: Total volume traded at that specific price

### Key Analysis Techniques:

#### 1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
```
VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
```
- More accurate than simple averages
- Shows true center of trading activity
- Compare current price to VWAP for direction signals

#### 2. Volume Distribution Analysis
- **High Volume Zones**: Price levels with >10% of total volume
- **Support/Resistance**: Prices with significant trading create psychological levels
- **Volume Concentration**: Calculate what % of volume is in top 3 traded prices

#### 3. Price Migration Patterns
- **Upward Migration**: Recent trading at higher prices than historical
- **Downward Migration**: Recent trading at lower prices than historical
- **Stable Trading**: Consistent price levels over time

#### 4. Market Sentiment Indicators
- **Heavy Trading Above Current**: Suggests market expects higher prices
- **Heavy Trading Below Current**: Suggests market expects lower prices
- **Balanced Distribution**: Uncertain market sentiment

## Confidence Scoring System (Numerical)

### Confidence Calculation (0-100%):
Calculate confidence score by summing points from each factor:

#### Historical Volume Signal Strength (0-30 points):
- **Extreme imbalance** (>2:1 ratio): 30 points
- **Strong imbalance** (1.5-2:1 ratio): 25 points  
- **Moderate imbalance** (1.2-1.5:1 ratio): 15 points
- **Balanced** (0.8-1.2:1 ratio): 0 points

#### Price Deviation Signal (0-25 points):
- **>20% deviation** from historical average: 25 points
- **10-20% deviation**: 18 points
- **5-10% deviation**: 12 points
- **<5% deviation**: 5 points

#### Traded Prices Distribution Analysis (0-20 points):
- **Strong concentration** (>60% volume in top 3 prices): 20 points
- **Moderate concentration** (40-60% volume in top 3 prices): 15 points
- **Balanced distribution** (20-40% volume in top 3 prices): 10 points
- **Wide distribution** (<20% volume in top 3 prices): 5 points

#### Offered Prices Signal Strength (0-25 points):
- **Extreme offered imbalance** (>3:1 ratio): 25 points
- **Strong offered imbalance** (2-3:1 ratio): 20 points
- **Moderate offered imbalance** (1.5-2:1 ratio): 15 points
- **Balanced offered prices** (0.8-1.5:1 ratio): 5 points

#### Signal Alignment (0-25 points):
- **All signals align** (historical + current + offered + traded distribution): 25 points
- **Three signals align**: 20 points
- **Two signals align**: 15 points
- **One signal only**: 8 points
- **Conflicting signals**: 0 points

#### Volume Liquidity Adjustment (Multiplier):
**Total Traded Volume** = Sum of all volumes in tradedPrices array

**Volume Adjustment Factor:**
- **High Volume** (>1000 total): 1.0 (no adjustment)
- **Medium Volume** (500-1000 total): 0.9 (10% reduction)
- **Low Volume** (100-500 total): 0.8 (20% reduction)
- **Very Low Volume** (50-100 total): 0.6 (40% reduction)
- **Minimal Volume** (<50 total): 0.4 (60% reduction)

**Final Confidence = Base Confidence × Volume Adjustment Factor**

### Confidence Categories:
- **80-100%**: Very High Confidence 🔴
- **60-79%**: High Confidence 🟡  
- **40-59%**: Medium Confidence 🟠
- **25-39%**: Low Confidence 🟢
- **<25%**: Very Low Confidence ⚪
