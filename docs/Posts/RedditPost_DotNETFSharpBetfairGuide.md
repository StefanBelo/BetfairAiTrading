**Title:** 🔧 From SOAP to AI Agents: My 18-Year Journey Building Betfair Trading Tools with .NET/F# 

Hey developers! 👋

Just wanted to share some insights for anyone interested in getting into Betfair programming, especially if you're coming from a .NET/F# background.

## The Evolution of Betfair APIs 📈
Back in 2007 when I started this journey, things were quite different:
- **Then:** SOAP-based services, £200/month API fees
- **Now:** REST/JSON-RPC APIs, one-time £299 activation fee
- **With Bfexplorer:** No additional API fees needed!

## Why Betfair is Like Financial Markets 💰
Unlike traditional bookmakers, Betfair is an exchange where users bet against each other. This creates trading opportunities:
- **Back bets:** Betting something will happen
- **Lay bets:** Betting something won't happen
- **Hedging:** Lock in profits or reduce losses by trading both sides

## What You Can Build 🛠️
The possibilities are endless with .NET/F#:
1. **Sports Data Analysis** - APIs and web scraping
2. **Data Visualization** - Charts and insights
3. **Machine Learning Models** - Predictive algorithms
4. **Bot Strategies** - Automated trading systems
5. **AI Agents** - Modern intelligent assistants

## Getting Started Today 🚀
1. Register on Betfair (check if legal in your country)
2. Download Bfexplorer App
3. Use **Practice Mode** - simulate bets without real money
4. Check out my open-source examples: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StefanBelo/BetfairAiTrading)

## Pro Tips for Developers 💡
- Start with Practice Mode - seriously, use it!
- Focus on strategy logic, not API complexity
- The Bfexplorer ecosystem handles the heavy lifting
- F# is surprisingly good for this domain

**Sample Console Script:** [Football Markets by Score](https://github.com/StefanBelo/BetfairAiTrading/blob/main/src/Strategies/Football/OpenMyFootballMarketsByScore.fsx)

## Important Disclaimer ⚠️
Always remember: betting carries financial risks. If you're not comfortable with those risks, stick to the technical challenges without real money!

Anyone else working on sports trading systems? Would love to hear about your experiences with different tech stacks!
