# Unlocking Smarter Betfair Trading: The Bfexplorer Agentic Approach

Dear Bfexplorer Subscriber,

We're excited to introduce a new way to make your Betfair trading smarter and easier—using the agentic approach with large language models (LLMs).

**What does this mean for you?**

With this approach, you can describe your trading ideas or strategies in plain language. The system then acts as your personal assistant, automatically gathering the right data, analyzing markets, and even placing bets for you—no coding or technical setup required.

**How does it work?**
- You write or choose a simple prompt describing what you want to achieve (for example: "Find value bets in today’s horse racing" or "Trade only if the favourite is overpriced").
- The agent understands your instructions, collects all the necessary market and runner data, and runs the analysis.
- If your criteria are met, the agent can place bets or alert you—saving you time and effort.

**What can you achieve?**
Data providers are mainly focused on horse racing, but there is also some base data available for football and tennis.

This agentic approach puts powerful AI at your fingertips, making Betfair trading more accessible and flexible than ever before.
