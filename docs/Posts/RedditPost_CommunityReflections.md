## Post Title: Reflecting on 67 Followers and the Challenge of Building a Developer Community

67 redditors are following BetfairAiTrading, generating around 3,000 views per month. While only 12% of viewers can legally access the Betfair Sports Exchange, I hope the rest find inspiration in my posts.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to attract software developers to collaborate on testing or building new tools using the Bfexplorer BOT SDK. There's so much potential to create web-based apps leveraging Bfexplorer's REST API and MCP tools, but with only 67 users and a fraction of them able to program, the pool is too small.

Despite this, I use what I share here almost daily. It's a source of inspiration, new ideas, and a reflection of everything I've learned. Currently, I'm running machine learning strategies in fully autonomous mode, with the AI agent serving as a support tool for research and idea generation based on the same data.

I understand that I can't share my data or profitable strategiesâ€”this should be clear to everyone. However, I encourage you to use the tools and insights I provide to gain a fresh perspective on Betfair strategy building. If you're new to Betfair betting or trading, do your research first, AI agents can be a great help in that journey.
