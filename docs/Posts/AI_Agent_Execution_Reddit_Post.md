# AI Agent Execution: Automation Approaches for Betfair Trading

Here's a quick overview of how you can automate Betfair trading using AI agents, based on my experience:

1. **FastAgent Python Library**: Program a Python script for each strategy. Great for full control, but requires coding for every strategy.
2. **ChatCompletionsClient C# Integration**: Load prompts from files and run AI workflows directly in your trading appâ€”no need to write scripts! Debugging is harder since you can't see the agent's conversation.
3. **AI CLI Tools (Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Qwen Code)**: Run strategies via console commands. Fast setup, but single-session execution makes debugging tough.
4. **Direct CLI Tool Usage with Text Injection**: Inject text into CLI tools for multisession execution. Big advantage: you can see the output and debug prompts easily, plus token caching helps performance.

**Summary:**
- Python scripting = full control
- C# integration = clever, script-free
- CLI tools = quick, but hard to debug
- Text injection = best for debugging and multisession workflows
