# Edge vs. Expected Value (EV) in Betting: Which Should You Use?

When analyzing betting opportunities, two key concepts often come up: **edge** and **expected value (EV)**. Understanding the difference between them—and knowing which to use—can make a big difference in your betting results.

**Edge** is the difference between your model’s estimated probability of an outcome and the probability implied by the market odds. For example, if you think a horse has a 20% chance to win ($p_{true} = 0.20$) and the market implies a 15% chance ($p_{mkt} = 0.15$), your edge is 0.05 (or 5%).

**Expected Value (EV)**, on the other hand, measures the average profit or loss you can expect per unit staked, taking into account both your probability and the odds offered. The formula is:
$$
EV = p_{true} \times (\text{price} - 1) - (1 - p_{true})
$$
A positive EV means the bet is profitable in the long run.

**Which is better to use?**

While edge tells you where your view differs from the market, **EV is the best metric for making betting decisions**. EV incorporates both your probability and the payout, directly showing whether a bet is worth taking. Always prioritize bets with positive EV, and use edge as a supporting diagnostic.

**Summary:**
- Use **EV** to decide which bets to place (bet only if EV > 0).
- Use **edge** to understand where your model disagrees with the market.

Focusing on positive EV is the most reliable way to make profitable betting decisions over time.
