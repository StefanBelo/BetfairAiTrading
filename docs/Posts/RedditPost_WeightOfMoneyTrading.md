# Cracking the Weight of Money Code: How AI Turned Me Into a Market Psychology Expert

Hey r/betfair and r/sportsbook,

Just wanted to share something that's been a game-changer for my Betfair trading - **Weight of Money analysis**. If you've never heard of this, you're missing out on one of the most powerful edge-finding tools in the trading toolkit.

## What is Weight of Money Analysis?

Basically, it's looking at WHERE the money has been traded historically vs. where it's being offered NOW. Think of it as market psychology made visible:

* **Average Back Traded**: Where smart money has been backing
* **Average Lay Traded**: Where smart money has been laying  
* **Current Offered Prices**: Where the market is RIGHT NOW
* **Volume Imbalances**: The tell-tale signs of what's coming next

## The "Aha!" Moment

Here's what blew my mind: **BetType interpretation is BACKWARDS from what you'd think:**

- **BetType 1 (Back) volume** = Money available to LAY (lay offers)
- **BetType 2 (Lay) volume** = Money available to BACK (back offers)

So when you see massive BetType 2 volumes, that's not laying pressure - it's **backing pressure**! The market is screaming "we want to back this horse" and odds are about to shorten.

## Real Trading Signals

I've been using an AI system that scores each selection 0-100% confidence based on:

**Signal Strength Factors:**
* Volume imbalances (>2:1 ratio = 30 points)
* Price deviation from historical averages (>20% = 25 points)  
* Offered price imbalances (>3:1 ratio = 25 points)
* Signal alignment across all factors (20 points max)

**The Magic:** When all signals align and you hit 70%+ confidence, that's when the AI automatically executes:
- **Shorten prediction** → Back Trade strategy
- **Drift prediction** → Lay Trade strategy

## Why This Works

Most punters look at current odds and think "is this value?" But they're missing the story the market is telling:

* If a horse is 4.0 now but historically traded at 3.5 average, AND there's massive BetType 2 volume building up → **steamer incoming**
* If there's heavy BetType 1 volume (lay offers) and current price is above historical average → **drifter alert**

## The Results So Far

I'm not going to claim crazy strike rates, but what I WILL say is this approach has completely changed how I see markets. Instead of guessing, I'm reading the collective intelligence of thousands of traders who've already put their money where their mouth is.

The psychological edge is huge too - when your system gives you 85% confidence on a trade, you're not second-guessing yourself at 3am wondering if you should exit.

## Technical Setup (For the Geeks)

I'm using BFExplorer with MCP integration and a comprehensive AI prompt that:
1. Pulls weight of money data for active markets
2. Calculates confidence scores using the numerical system
3. Automatically executes strategies when thresholds are met
4. Applies volume liquidity adjustments (low volume = reduced confidence)

The whole system is documented in my [Weight of Money Strategy prompt](https://github.com/StefanBelo/BetfairAiTrading/blob/main/docs/Prompts/WeightOfMoneyStrategy.md) if anyone wants to dive deeper.

## Questions for the Community

* Has anyone else experimented with weight of money analysis?
* What's your experience with automated strategy execution vs. manual trading?
* Any tips for interpreting volume patterns in volatile markets?

Really curious to hear if others have discovered similar patterns or have different approaches to reading market sentiment!

*TL;DR: Weight of money analysis reveals market psychology through historical vs. current trading patterns. AI can automate the pattern recognition and execution, turning market sentiment into systematic trading edges.*
