# üéâ Success! AiAgentCSharp Integration Finally Working with Multiple LLM Providers

**TL;DR**: After struggling with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration in C#, I finally got my AiAgentCSharp working flawlessly with GitHub AI, DeepSeek, and AiHubMix! Huge thanks to u/elbrunoc for the code examples that made the breakthrough possible.

## The Journey

I've been working on integrating AI models with my Betfair trading application through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), specifically connecting to my BfexplorerApp MCP server. The goal was to create an AI agent that could analyze betting markets and execute strategies automatically.

**The challenge?** Getting the MCP tool integration to work properly with different LLM providers in C#.

## What's Working Now ‚úÖ

### Supported LLM Providers:
- **GitHub AI** (GPT-4.1) 
- **DeepSeek** (deepseek-chat)
- **AiHubMix** (alternative GPT-4.1 endpoint)

### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ Seamless MCP client connection to localhost:10043
- ‚úÖ Real-time tool discovery from BfexplorerApp MCP server
- ‚úÖ AI model integration with streaming responses
- ‚úÖ Automated betting strategy execution
- ‚úÖ Support for advanced analysis (R5 Favourite Analysis, Win-to-Place data)

## The Technical Stack

```csharp
// The magic happens with Microsoft.Extensions.AI
IChatClient chatClient = AiAgentHelpers.CreateGithubChatClient("openai/gpt-4.1");
// Or: CreateDeepSeekChatClient("deepseek-chat");
// Or: CreateAiHubMixChatClient("gpt-4.1");

// MCP connection to my betting app
IMcpClient mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(
    new SseClientTransport(
        new SseClientTransportOptions
        {
            Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:10043"),
            TransportMode = HttpTransportMode.StreamableHttp
        }
    )
);

// The breakthrough - tools integration
var tools = await mcpClient.ListToolsAsync();
var chatOptions = new ChatOptions { Tools = [.. tools] };
```

## Key Dependencies That Made It Work

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.AI" Version="9.8.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.AI.AzureAIInference" Version="9.8.0-preview.1.25412.6" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI" Version="9.8.0-preview.1.25412.6" />
<PackageReference Include="ModelContextProtocol.Core" Version="0.3.0-preview.4" />
```

## What My AI Agent Can Do Now

### Real-time Market Analysis
- Connects to live Betfair markets through MCP
- Analyzes horse racing form data and expected values
- Executes R5 Favourite Analysis with probability-based decisions
- Processes candlestick data and volume intelligence

### Strategy Automation
```csharp
string prompt = MyPrompts.ActiveBetfairMarket;
// AI analyzes the market and can execute:
// - Conservative betting strategies
// - STEAM/DRIFT signal analysis  
// - Win-to-Place divergence analysis
// - Automated back/lay decisions
```

## The Breakthrough Moment

The key was understanding how to properly configure the `ChatOptions` with MCP tools and ensuring the streaming response handling worked correctly across different providers. Each LLM provider had slightly different quirks in their API implementations.

**Big shoutout to u/elbrunoc** - your code examples were exactly what I needed to see the proper patterns for MCP integration! üôè

## What's Next

Now that the foundation is solid, I'm expanding to:
- More sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms
- Additional AI provider integrations
- Enhanced real-time market data processing
- Integration with my existing 120+ AI prompts collection

## For Fellow Developers

If you're working with MCP and multiple LLM providers in C#, the key lessons I learned:

1. **Use Microsoft.Extensions.AI** - It's a game changer for provider abstraction
2. **SSE transport works best** for MCP connections  
3. **Tool integration requires careful ChatOptions configuration**
4. **Test with multiple providers** - they each have unique behaviors
5. **Streaming responses need proper handling** for each provider

The full implementation is part of my [BetfairAiTrading project](https://github.com/StefanBelo/BetfairAiTrading/tree/main/src/AiAgentCSharp) if anyone wants to dive deeper into the code.

## Community

This is part of a larger ecosystem I'm building around AI-powered betting analysis. We have:
- 120+ specialized AI prompts for market analysis
- Python and C# implementations
- Weekly analysis reports and strategy updates
- Open source research and documentation

Would love to hear about similar projects or if anyone has suggestions for additional LLM providers to integrate!
