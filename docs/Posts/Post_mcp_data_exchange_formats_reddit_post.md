# Data Exchange Formats for MCP Servers: What Do You Use? 🔄💡

Hey everyone! I'm reaching out to the community to learn more about your real-world experiences with data exchange formats when building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## The Question

When you design your MCP server, which data format do you use to communicate with clients or agents?

- 🟦 **JSON**: The classic, easy-to-use, and widely supported
- 🟨 **YAML**: Human-friendly and great for configs
- 🟧 **XML**: Powerful for complex, structured data
- 🟩 **CSV**: Simple and efficient for tabular data
- 🟪 **Custom or other**: Something unique to your workflow?

## Why It Matters

Choosing the right data format can impact:

- ⚡ **Performance**: Speed and efficiency of data transfer
- 🔒 **Reliability**: How robust and error-proof your system is
- 🔄 **Interoperability**: How easily you can integrate with other tools or languages
- 🛠️ **Ease of use**: How simple it is to debug, maintain, and extend
