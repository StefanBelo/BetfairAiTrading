# Programming vs AI: The Future of Automated Trading

Last week, I asked readers which programming languages they use to automate their trading activities on Betfair. I received responses from two individuals: one uses **Golang** and the other **C++**. Unfortunately, neither of them provided any example code for a simple trading strategy, which would have been helpful for those interested in other programming languages or looking to learn by comparing different approaches.

Meanwhile, on a different forum, a PHP programmer shared some example code for a basic strategy in **PHP**. I also posted sample implementations in **F#**, **C#**, and **Visual Basic**. As a result, we now have code samples in four different programming languages, offering a good opportunity to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each.

## The Role of Modern AI

However, we all seem to be overlooking the role of modern AI approaches. Nowadays, any spoken language—such as **English** or **Slovak**—can essentially serve as executable instructions for large language models. 

For example, you could simply say:

> "On the currently active Betfair market, sort the market selections by price in ascending order and immediately execute the 'Lay 10 Euro' strategy on the first three favourites."

These two sentences describe exactly what needs to be done, and thanks to AI, there’s no traditional programming required.

## The Big Question

What do you think is the best approach: to start learning a *programming language* or to start learning to use *AI tools*?

*My thoughts:*

While traditional programming offers precise control and performance (especially with languages like C++ and Go), the barrier to entry is high. AI-driven "development" using natural language changes the paradigm entirely. It democratizes the ability to create trading bots, but it also raises new questions about reliability and testing. Can we trust an LLM to execute financial transactions without the strict type safety of F# or the memory management of C++? Perhaps the future isn't one or the other, but a hybrid: AI tools generating the boilerplate, while human experts verify the critical logic.
