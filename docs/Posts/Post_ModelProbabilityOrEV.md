**Why Expected Value (EV) is the Only Way to Win on the Betfair Exchange**

I see a lot of people say they just back the horse (or outcome) their model rates as most likely. But on the Betfair Exchange, that's a fatal error. **If you aren’t considering the odds and commission to find positive expected value (+EV), you’re GUARANTEED to lose long-term—even if your model is a world-class winner-picker.**

**Why? The Exchange Isn't a Charity**
Unlike a traditional bookie, there's no built-in margin in the odds. You're betting against other people. However, the market takes its cut in two ways:
1.  **The Back/Lay Spread:** The natural "margin" of the market.
2.  **Commission:** Betfair takes a percentage of your net winnings on a market. This is the silent killer of unprofitable strategies.

If you just back the favourite without considering the price, you're often taking poor value that gets eaten away by commission.

**The Correct EV Calculation for the Exchange**

Your goal is to only place bets where the odds offered by the market are better than your model's assessed probability, even after commission.

**For a BACK Bet:**
Your potential profit is reduced by commission.
`EV = ( (Back Odds - 1) * (1 - Commission Rate) ) * Your Probability - (1 - Your Probability)`

**For a LAY Bet:**
Here, you act as the bookie. You win the backer's stake if the outcome *doesn't* happen.
`EV = (1 - Commission Rate) * (1 - Your Probability) - (Lay Odds - 1) * Your Probability`

- If the result is positive: You have a value bet. Over time, you will make money.
- If negative: You are guaranteed to lose money long-term.

**The Golden Rule:**
- Don’t just “back the likeliest winner.”
- **Only back a selection when the odds are high enough to be profitable *after* commission.**
- **Only lay a selection when the odds are low enough that the liability is smaller than the true risk.**

Long-term, **EV-focused betting is the only profitable way to approach the Betfair Exchange**. Price is EVERYTHING.

*(And for staking, use the Kelly criterion or a derivative. But that’s a different post!)*
