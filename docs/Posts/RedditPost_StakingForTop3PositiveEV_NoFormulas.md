# Dutching 3 +EV Horses vs Backing Only the Top EV — What’s Your Go-To?

TL;DR
- Best default: stake more on your strongest edge across the best 3 positive‑EV horses (fractional Kelly style without the math here), with a tight per‑race exposure cap.
- Smoother alternative: equal‑profit dutching on the 3 only when all are genuinely +EV and your combined chance of winning is strong.
- Not recommended: picking the biggest odds just because they’re big; backing all 3 only because odds are above some threshold (like 3.5). Odds levels alone don’t create edge.
- If one selection clearly dominates, backing only the top pick can make more sense than spreading thinly.

How I handle it in practice
- Calibrate probabilities conservatively and require positive value after a safety haircut.
- Set a small per‑race exposure cap (e.g., around 1–2% of bankroll) and stick to it.
- Use minimum acceptable odds and keep orders to avoid bad fills.
- When the three edges look similar and the combined chance feels strong, I dutch for equal profit to smooth variance.
- When one edge is clearly superior, I concentrate on that runner and may add a small stake to runner #2 if its edge still looks solid.

What I’m asking the community
- When you find three positive‑EV runners, what’s your default?
  - Equal‑profit dutching?
  - Stake more on the strongest and less on the others?
  - Back only the top pick?
- What “combined chance” or quality threshold convinces you to dutch instead of going single‑runner?
- How do you set your per‑race exposure cap in practice?
- Any exchange execution tips you rely on (price floors, keep orders, skip if liquidity is thin, etc.)?
