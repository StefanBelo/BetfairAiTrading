# The Hottest New Programming Language Is English

Andrej Karpathy recently famously claimed, **"The hottest new programming language is English."** It’s a catchy phrase, but what does it actually look like in practice? It’s not just about writing code comments or documentation; it’s about controlling complex systems and executing logic using natural language instead of rigid syntax.

I experienced this firsthand while building automation tools for Betfair trading. Typically, interacting with a trading API, filtering data, and controlling a desktop application would require writing a code in F# or C#, handling authentication, parsing JSON, writing loops, and making API calls.

But with an AI agent integrated into the development environment (using the Model Context Protocol), the "code" becomes a simple conversation.

## A Real-World Example

Here is a prompt I used recently to manage my trading workspace. I needed to find live football matches that were just starting (under 30 minutes played) and open them in my trading software, **BfExplorer**.

**The Prompt:**

> *"Retrieve data context with the name 'PlayingFootballMatchScoresData' and then list all matches with score and match time less than 30 minutes. Then open all these matches markets in bfexplorer."*

## The Execution

Behind the scenes, the AI didn't just "chat." It performed a series of distinct programmatic actions that would usually require a dedicated script:

1.  **Data Retrieval:** It called a tool to fetch a specific data context (`PlayingFootballMatchScoresData`) containing live match stats.
2.  **Logic & Filtering:** It parsed that data, checking the `MatchTime` property of every single active match and filtering for `MatchTime < 30`.
3.  **Application Control:** It iterated through the filtered list and executed a command to physically open those specific markets in the *BfExplorer* application.

## The Result

I didn't write a `foreach` loop. I didn't query an endpoint manually. I just described my *intent* in English. Here is the actual output generated by the agent:

```text

Findings ✅

I retrieved the global data context PlayingFootballMatchScoresData and found matches that have score data and a MatchTime < 30 minutes.
I opened all of those markets in Bfexplorer.

This identifies the shift Karpathy is talking about. We aren't replacing programmers; we are elevating the abstraction layer. English allows us to focus on the *what* (business logic: "find early matches") rather than the *how* (implementation details: "iterate array index i").

If you are building tools today, the most powerful interface you can give your users might just be a text box.
