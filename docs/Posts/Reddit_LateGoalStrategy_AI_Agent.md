Title: Can We Automate a Late Goal Football Strategy Using AI Prompts?

I have just read a forum post on one Betfair software provider, it is about football strategy. People there like football strategies even though the software is not providing football score. People just judge score by monitoring all overs market for a football match. One of the strategies is following:

I would really like to know whether it is possible to automate betting on a late goal, based on the time of the first goal, no matter what the scoreline is at that point.

For example, if a game has a first goal within the first 10 minutes of the match, can I place an automated bet on 85 minutes, no matter the scoreline at that point. It could still be 1 nil, 2-1, 5-1 or 3-3, etc.

I want to ask the community: Do you think it is possible to create such a strategy just by using an AI agent prompt? Has anyone tried to set up something like this?

Also, which sources could we use for reliable and fast football data to make this work? Any tips or experiences would be appreciated!
