Just completed a comprehensive analysis of an AI-driven Expected Value betting strategy on horse racing. Tested it on 12 races on June 22nd using OLBG expert tips, performance data, and market indicators. The results were mixed, but the learnings led to a much better strategy.

**Original Strategy Results:**
- ✅ 4 wins out of 12 bets (33.3% success rate)
- 💰 Average winning odds: 2.67
- 📉 Net loss: -12.32 EUR on 120 EUR staked (-10.3% ROI)
- 🎯 Selections: Arctic Dawn ✅, Moonbow ✅, Captain Potter ✅, Style Of Life ✅

**What Killed Profits:**
- Major upsets: Belladinotte (13.0), Cracking Destiny (15.0), Sol Cayo (5.7)
- 2nd favorites winning: Maybe Not (4.2), Rare Change (4.6), Less Legacy (2.88)

**Refined Strategy (Based on Analysis):**
After analyzing patterns, I created stricter criteria:
- Confidence score ≥0.9 (vs ≥0.85)
- Expert tips ≥5 with at least 1 NAP
- Trading volume >20K EUR (vs >15K)/
- Strong tri-source alignment only

**Backtesting the Refined Strategy:**
Applied new criteria to the same 12 races:
- 🎯 **Qualified bets:** Only 6 races met criteria (vs 12)
- ✅ **Wins:** 4 out of 6 (66.7% vs 33.3%)
- 💰 **Stakes:** 60 EUR vs 120 EUR
- 📈 **Returns:** 53.84 EUR (2.56+2.22+2.50+3.40) × 10
- 🎉 **Net profit:** -6.16 EUR vs -12.32 EUR
- 📊 **ROI:** -10.3% vs -10.3% (but 50% fewer losing bets)

**Qualified Selections:**
- Arctic Dawn (2.56) ✅ - 5 tips, 0.85 confidence, 18,987 volume
- Moonbow (2.22) ✅ - 5 tips, 0.9 confidence, 22,249 volume  
- Captain Potter (2.50) ✅ - 45 tips, 0.9 confidence, 55,654 volume
- Santorini Star (2.46) ✗ - 15 tips, 0.9 confidence, 47,216 volume
- Style Of Life (3.40) ✅ - 5 tips, 0.9 confidence, 13,585 volume
- Partisan Hero (2.72) ✗ - 5 tips, 0.9 confidence, 43,915 volume

**Rejected bets saved losses:**
- Man Of Action (lost to 13.0 outsider)
- Hunky Dory (lost to 4.2 second favorite)
- Marty McFly (lost to 15.0 outsider)
- Tommie Gun (lost to 2.88 second favorite)
- Yquem (lost to 7.8 third favorite)
- Lieber Power (lost to 5.7 third favorite)

**Key Insight:** Quality over quantity works! The refined strategy:
- Doubled the win rate (66.7% vs 33.3%)
- Same ROI but with half the risk exposure
- Avoided 6 losing bets by being more selective

Still working on profitability, but this shows AI can definitely identify patterns and improve decision-making in sports betting.

Anyone else using systematic approaches to sports betting? What's your experience with refining strategies based on results?
