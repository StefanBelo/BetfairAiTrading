# Dutching 3 “Value” Horses vs Backing Only the Best One — Simple Guide

TL;DR
- Default: put most of your stake on the strongest pick; add smaller stakes to #2 and #3 only if they also look genuinely strong.
- Want smoother results? Dutch the 3 for about the same profit whichever wins, but only if all three look like real value and your overall chance feels strong.
- Don’t do this: pick the biggest odds just because they’re big, or back all three just because the odds are above some number (like 3.5). Those rules don’t create value.

How to keep it simple
1) Only bet horses you believe are real value (your view says their chance is better than the market).
2) Cap risk: keep your total spend per race small (for most people, around 1–2% of bankroll is sensible).
3) If one horse clearly stands out: back just that one.
4) If two or three look similar and the overall chance of hitting feels strong: dutch them so you win roughly the same no matter which one wins.
5) If prices collapse or there isn’t enough money available to match your bets, skip the race.

Easy examples
- One stands out: back the top pick. If you still like #2, you can add a small side bet. Skip #3 if it’s only “okay.”
- All three look strong and close in quality: use dutching to aim for about the same win whichever one lands.

What not to do
- Don’t pick the biggest odds just for the payout. Big prices can be great or terrible — it depends on whether you truly have value.
- Don’t back all three just because their odds are over 3.5. Odds levels alone don’t make a good bet.

Execution tips
- Set a minimum price you’re willing to take and use keep orders so you’re not filled at a worse price.
- If prices move a lot before the off, rethink or reduce your stakes.
- Track results and review your judgments — be conservative until you know your reads are reliable.
