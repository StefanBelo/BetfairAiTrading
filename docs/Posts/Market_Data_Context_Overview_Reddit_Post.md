Just documented the comprehensive data contexts available in our Betfair trading system. Here's what we can analyze:

🏇 **OLBG Racing Tips** - Professional tipster confidence ratings and analysis  
📈 **Custom Performance Metrics** - In-play ratings, trends, and win percentages  
💰 **Price History** - Complete trading volumes and price movements over time  
📰 **Racing Post Form** - Official ratings and detailed race descriptions  
🔄 **Weight of Money** - Real-time money flow showing smart vs public betting  
⭐ **Timeform Ratings** - Professional star ratings with condition suitability  
📊 **Trading Summary** - Key price metrics and total volumes traded  
🎯 **Betfair Base Form** - Official form figures, weights, and forecast prices  

Each context provides unique insights that can be combined for comprehensive market analysis. The system pulls real-time data across all these dimensions for any active Betfair market.

These data contexts can be leveraged by AI agents for rapid strategy development, as discussed in our recent post about transitioning from traditional ML to agentic strategy development - what used to take weeks of coding can now be accomplished in hours through natural language instructions.

Anyone else working with similar multi-dimensional betting data? What contexts do you find most valuable for strategy development?
