**TL;DR: My automated horse racing strategy analyzed 21 races on June 25th, backed 21 selections, hit 6 winners (28.6% strike rate) but still delivered 77.6% ROI (€162.90 profit from €210 stakes). Here's the breakdown.**

Just finished analyzing yesterday's performance of my AI-driven horse racing strategy and wanted to share some interesting results with the community.

## The Numbers That Matter
- **21 races analyzed, 21 bets placed** (€10 each)
- **6 winners from 21 selections** = 28.6% strike rate
- **Total profit: €162.90** on €210 stakes = **77.6% ROI**
- **Best win**: Notimeforchitchat at 18.5 odds (€185 return!)

## What Made It Work
The strategy combines multiple AI components:
- **Semantic form analysis** (85.4% accuracy on winners)
- **Prediction scoring** (92.3% average for winning picks)
- **Market stability assessment**
- **Crowd wisdom adjustment factors**

## The Sweet Spot
Interestingly, the most profitable selections fell in the 3.0-8.0 odds range. The system correctly identified value in mid-range horses that the market had slightly underestimated.

## What Needs Fixing
Despite the profit, there are clear issues:
- **Expected value calculations are overestimating** by ~30%
- **Strike rate should be higher** for long-term sustainability
- **Too many marginal selections** getting through filters

## Key Insight
The 28.6% strike rate might look low, but when you hit a few bigger priced winners (like that 18.5 shot), the math works out beautifully. This is why **ROI matters more than strike rate** in horse racing.

## Next Steps
Working on tightening the selection criteria and recalibrating the value assessments. The foundation is clearly solid - just needs some fine-tuning.
