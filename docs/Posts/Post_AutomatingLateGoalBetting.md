## Automating Late Goal Betting Based on First Goal Timing in Football

I have just read a forum post on one Betfair software provider, it is about football strategy. People there like football strategies even though the software is not providing football score. People just judge score by monitoring all overs market for a football match. One of the strategies is following:

> I would really like to know whether it is possible to automate betting on a late goal, based on the time of the first goal, no matter what the scoreline is at that point.
> 
> For example, if a game has a first goal within the first 10 minutes of the match, can I place an automated bet on 85 minutes, no matter the scoreline at that point. It could still be 1 nil, 2-1, 5-1 or 3-3, etc.

This approach is interesting because it focuses on the timing of the first goal, not the actual scoreline. The idea is to trigger an automated bet at a specific minute (like the 85th minute) if the first goal happens early in the match, no matter what the score is at that time.

**My question for the community:**

- Do you think it is possible to create such a strategy just by using an AI agent prompt?
- Has anyone tried to set up something like this?
- Which sources could we use for reliable and fast football data to make this work?

Any tips, experiences, or suggestions would be appreciated!
