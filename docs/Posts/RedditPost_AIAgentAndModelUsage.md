**What AI Agents & Models Are You Actually Using (and Paying For)? My experience with Copilot Pro, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini.**

## Post Content

Hey everyone,

I'm curious to know what AI agents and models the community is using for development, trading, and analysis. I've been experimenting with a few, and my experience has been a mixed bag.

I'm currently on **GitHub Copilot Pro**, but after just 4 days, I've hit my "premium request allowance" and can't access models like Claude anymore. It's a bit frustrating to pay for a service and get cut off so quickly.

I also paid for **DeepSeek**, which I'm using mostly through Cherry Studio. The model itself is great, but I can't integrate it into my preferred client, the GitHub Copilot AI agent.

Now, I'm testing out the **Gemini CLI**, and it seems promising so far, but it's still early days.

This has me wondering what everyone else's setup looks like.

- What AI agents are you using day-to-day? (Copilot, Codeium, something else?)
- Which models are you finding the most effective? (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, Llama 3, etc.)
- Are you paying for premium access, and do you feel like you're getting your money's worth?
- Have you found a good way to integrate different models into your workflow?

Looking for recommendations and to hear about your experiences. What's working for you?
