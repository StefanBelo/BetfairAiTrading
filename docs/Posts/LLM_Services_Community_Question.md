# Community Question: Paid and Free LLM Services Usage

Hello everyone,

I'm curious to learn more about our community's experience with Large Language Model (LLM) services. Specifically:

- How many members here use paid LLM services? If so, which ones do you use?

For reference, I personally use:
- GitHub Copilot ($10/month subscription, GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4 models)
- Prepaid Deepseek LLM

Additionally, I'm interested to know how many of you are aware that there are LLM providers which could offer Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration for advanced automation and trading workflows. If you use any of these, please share your experiences!

Here are some LLM providers that could offer MCP server integration:
- OpenAI (API access, supports custom integration)
- Deepseek (API access)
- Mistral AI (API access)
- Together AI (API access)
- Hugging Face (API access, custom endpoints)
- Google Gemini (API access)
- OpenRouter (API access)

If you know of other LLM providers supporting MCP server integration, please add them in the comments!

Looking forward to hearing about your experiences and recommendations.

Thanks,
Stefan
