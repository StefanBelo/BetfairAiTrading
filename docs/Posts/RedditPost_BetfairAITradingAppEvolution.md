# Reddit Post: The Evolution of My Betfair AI Trading App - From Simple Testing to Full AI Automation

## Original Text:

One month ago, I created a Betfair AI Trading community on Reddit. It all started with a new feature in my app that allowed users to simply open a strategy for testing. While it was a small feature, it actually helped me document all my tests and ideas for data retrieval from the many websites I had been parsing for years for my betting purposes and machine learning strategies I execute on the Betfair sports exchange.

This development was followed by exploring AI agent possibilities that would extend my app for daily use and for researching new ideas for Betfair strategies. My first attempt was to use an AI agent as a means for rules/criteria creation, which is called "trigger betting" in some Betfair apps. 

The next step was implementing a help system for my app. Since I started working on this hobby project back in 2007, some lesser-used features in betting or trading strategies had been forgotten. Now I can simply ask the AI agent about trading strategies and required parameters, and within seconds I get an answer.

The following step was to make my app fully agentic, which I have fully achieved at this stage. My app is now able to execute AI strategies similar to my ML strategies in fully automatic mode. The next stage will involve AI agent strategy backtesting and analyzing execution rules, as these differ slightly from model to model.

**Title:** From Manual Testing to Full AI Automation: My 18-Year Journey Building a Betfair Trading App ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ

Hey r/BetfairAiTrading! ðŸ‘‹

A month ago I started this community, and I wanted to share the evolution of my Betfair trading app - a journey that's taken some unexpected turns into AI territory.

## The Humble Beginning ðŸŒ±
It all started with a simple feature: allowing users to easily open strategies for testing. Small addition, huge impact. This one feature became the foundation for documenting years of work - all my data scraping from various betting sites, ML strategies, and countless experiments on the Betfair exchange.

## The AI Revolution Begins ðŸš€
As AI agents became more accessible, I saw an opportunity to extend my app beyond its original scope:

**Phase 1: Rule Creation Assistant**
- Used AI to help create betting rules and criteria
- Essentially automated "trigger betting" (familiar to anyone who's used other Betfair apps)
- Huge time saver for strategy development

**Phase 2: The Knowledge Keeper** ðŸ§ 
- Since starting this project in **2007** (!), I'd forgotten some of the lesser-used features
- Now I just ask the AI: "What trading strategies are available and what parameters do they need?"
- Instant answers instead of digging through old documentation

**Phase 3: Full Automation** âš¡
- The big achievement: made the entire app fully agentic
- AI strategies now execute automatically, just like my ML models
- No more manual intervention required

## What's Next? ðŸ”®
Currently working on:
- AI strategy backtesting systems
- Execution rule analysis (varies between different AI models)
- Performance optimization and risk management

## The Community Vision ðŸŽ¯
This subreddit exists because I believe we're at the beginning of something big. AI is transforming how we approach betting strategies, and I want to share this journey with others who are equally passionate about the intersection of AI and sports trading.

**Questions for the community:**
- What AI features would you find most valuable in a trading app?
- Anyone else working on similar automation projects?
- What's your biggest challenge in Betfair strategy development?

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!
