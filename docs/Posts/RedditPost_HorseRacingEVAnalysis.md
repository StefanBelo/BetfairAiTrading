Just completed a comprehensive analysis of an AI-driven Expected Value betting strategy on horse racing. Tested it on 12 races on June 22nd using OLBG expert tips, performance data, and market indicators.

**The Results:**
- ✅ 4 wins out of 12 bets (33.3% success rate)
- 💰 Average winning odds: 2.67
- 📉 Net loss: -12.32 EUR on 120 EUR staked (-10.3% ROI)

**What Worked:**
- All winning selections had 5+ expert tips with at least 1 NAP (best bet)
- High confidence scores (≥0.85) were crucial
- Strong trading volume (>18K EUR) was a good indicator
- Maiden races performed better (67% success) vs handicaps (33%)

**What Didn't:**
- Major upsets killed profits (horses at 13.0+ odds winning)
- Market confidence didn't always translate to results
- Large field handicaps were unpredictable

**Key Takeaway:** The strategy shows promise but needs refinement. Planning to:
- Raise confidence threshold to 0.9
- Require minimum 20K EUR trading volume
- Focus on 2-3 highest confidence bets per day max

**The Math:** 33% win rate at 2.67 average odds = break-even territory. With better selection criteria, this could be profitable.
