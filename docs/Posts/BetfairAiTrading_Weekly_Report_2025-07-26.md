Betfair AI Trading Weekly (30)

1. ML apps and/or ML libraries

This week, the Reddit community discussed preferences for using direct machine learning libraries versus no-code ML applications. Most participants favored open-source libraries due to their flexibility and customization options. Some highlighted the ability to amend and extend library functionality, while others emphasized the importance of choosing a programming language that suits their needs. There was practical feedback on tools like Orange ML and ML.NET, including technical details about performance and retraining. On the other hand, no-code ML pipelines were criticized for being expensive and less flexible, with some users expressing disinterest in closed-source or no-code solutions. Concerns were also raised about long processing times for large datasets.

- My Post: Asked the community whether they prefer direct ML libraries or no-code ML applications for machine learning.
- Positive Reactions:
  - Users prefer open-source libraries for flexibility and customization.
  - Some value the ability to amend and extend library functionality.
  - Comments highlighted the benefits of choosing a programming language and starting from there.
  - Practical feedback on using Orange ML and ML.NET, with technical details about performance and retraining.
- Negative Reactions:
  - No-code ML pipelines are seen as too expensive and less flexible.
  - Some users are uninterested in closed-source or no-code solutions.
  - Concerns about long processing times for large datasets.

2. ML for horse racing

Another topic focused on structuring machine learning training data for horse racing, specifically whether to use one line per horse or one line per race. Community members shared their approaches to handling multiple runners and provided technical advice on model outputs and lay betting probabilities. However, challenges were noted with models predicting multiple winners and issues with data formatting due to varying numbers of horses per race.

3. The Death of Traditional Betting Strategy Development? AI Agents Are Changing Everything

The community also explored the shift from traditional machine learning strategy development to agentic AI approaches. The discussion highlighted the speed and accessibility advantages of AI agents, with examples from football betting. Many agreed on the benefits of rapid prototyping, pattern recognition, and hybrid workflows that combine AI and traditional coding. Nevertheless, concerns were expressed about the loss of transparency and control with AI agents, the need for traditional coding for regulatory compliance and large capital deployment, and skepticism about fully replacing established methods.
