### How Much Data is Too Much When Building Your Model?

The community discussion around data quantity in betting models reveals a common struggle between model sophistication and performance. The original poster's experience of initially seeing improvements with each new variable, only to later question if they're adding noise rather than signal, resonates with many algorithmic betting practitioners.

**Positive Reactions:**
- Strong consensus that feature selection is crucial - "less is often more" when it comes to meaningful variables
- Support for systematic approaches like recursive feature elimination and correlation analysis
- Emphasis on cross-validation and out-of-sample testing to identify genuine improvements vs. overfitting
- Recommendation to track model performance metrics over time to identify when complexity stops adding value
- Appreciation for domain knowledge in selecting relevant features rather than pure data-driven approaches

**Negative Reactions:**
- Frustration with the "curse of dimensionality" where more data leads to worse performance
- Concerns about overfitting becoming more likely as feature count increases
- Skepticism about blindly adding data without theoretical justification
- Warning against the temptation to keep adding features hoping for marginal gains
- Criticism of "kitchen sink" approaches where everything gets thrown into the model

**Opinion & Recommendations:**

The optimal amount of data isn't about volume but about relevance and signal quality. Start with a simple baseline model using core features that have strong theoretical backing in your betting domain. Add complexity incrementally, validating each addition through robust backtesting on unseen data.

Key principles for data selection:
1. **Domain expertise first** - understand what variables actually matter in your betting market
2. **Statistical validation** - use feature importance scores, correlation analysis, and stepwise selection
3. **Occam's Razor** - prefer simpler models that explain the same variance
4. **Rolling validation** - continuously test model performance on new data to catch degradation
5. **Information coefficient tracking** - monitor if new features actually improve predictive power

The sweet spot typically lies in having 5-15 truly meaningful features rather than hundreds of marginally relevant ones. Focus on feature engineering quality over quantity, and remember that a model you understand and can explain will be more robust than a black box with perfect backtested performance.

Regular model auditing should include feature ablation studies - temporarily removing features to see if performance actually degrades. If removing a feature doesn't hurt (or even helps), it was likely adding noise. This disciplined approach prevents the common trap of complexity creep that many algorithmic bettors fall into.
