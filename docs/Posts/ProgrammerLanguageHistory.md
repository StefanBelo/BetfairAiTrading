# Programmers of r/BetfairAITrading — When Did You Start and What Language?

Quick question for the programmers here: **When did you start programming and which language did you use?**

I started back in 2007 with C#, then switched to F# when it appeared and fell in love with functional programming. Today I'm still actively using both F# and C# for Betfair development, along with Visual Basic and Python when needed.

My codebase has grown to about 200 projects over the years, and 121 of them are still active — or rather, what those projects implement is still relevant here in 2026.

Curious to hear your stories! Drop a comment with:
- Your start year
- First programming language
- What you're using now for Betfair/trading

Looking forward to hearing from you all!
