## Title
🚀 Automated Football Trading: Using Real-Time Match Criteria for Strategy Triggers

## Post Content

Just wanted to share something cool I've been working on with automated football (soccer) betting strategies!

**The Problem:** Most trading strategies are too basic - they don't consider the actual match context like current score, time remaining, or red cards.

**My Solution:** Built a strategy system that uses real-time match data to trigger trades based on specific criteria:

### What it tracks:
- ⏱️ **Match Time** (live minutes)
- ⚽ **Current Score** (home vs away)
- 🎯 **Total Goals** 
- 📊 **Score Difference**
- 🟥 **Red Cards** (both teams)
- ⚡ **Match Status** (FirstHalf, SecondHalf, etc.)
- 🚩 **Corners Difference**

### Example Strategy Trigger:
```
[Status] = 'SecondHalfKickOff' And [MatchTime] = 45
```
This executes a trade right at the start of the second half - perfect for Over/Under markets!

### Why This Works:
- 📈 **Context-Aware**: Considers actual match situation
- 🎯 **Precise Timing**: Executes at exact moments
- 🔄 **Live Updates**: All parameters update in real-time
- 🧠 **Smart Logic**: Combine multiple criteria with AND/OR

The system shows live data like:
`MatchTime: 52, Score: 0-3, Goals: 3, ScoreDifference: -3, RedCards: 1-0`

Perfect for traders who want to automate their football strategies without losing the human insight of match context!

**Platform:** Using Bfexplorer with Betfair Exchange
**Status:** Live testing with paper trading first (always!)

Anyone else working on context-aware betting automation? Would love to hear your approaches!
