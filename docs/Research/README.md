## 1. Core Studies

- **Betfair Starting Price (BSP)**  
  File: [BetfairSP.md](BetfairSP.md)  
  Focus: Efficiency, value benchmarking, strategic usage/avoidance patterns

- **Horse Racing Exchange Market Structure**  
  File: [HorseRacing.md](HorseRacing.md)  
  Focus: Academic synthesis—efficiency, microstructure, BSP convergence, modeling

- **Staking for Positive‑EV Selections (Top 3 picks)**  
  File: [EVStakingForTop3Selections.md](EVStakingForTop3Selections.md)  
  Focus: Dutching vs fractional Kelly, decision rules, risk caps, and automation mapping

## 2. Practical Application Themes

- **BSP Value & Convergence**  
  Start with: BetfairSP.md and HorseRacing.md (Sections 5 & 7)  
  Key outputs: BSP edge metrics, price ratio filters

- **Drift & Volatility Modeling**  
  Start with: HorseRacing.md (Sections 2–4, 8)  
  Key outputs: Drift velocity, regime flags, movement features

- **Risk & Staking Frameworks**  
  Start with: HorseRacing.md (Sections 6, 10, 11)  
  Key outputs: Capped Kelly, exposure throttles, robustness checks

- **Feature Engineering Cheat Sheet**  
  Start with: HorseRacing.md (Section 14)  
  Key outputs: Minimal sets for drift, scalp, value filters

## 3. How to Use These Resources

1. Read `BetfairSP.md` to understand BSP’s role as terminal consensus anchor.
2. Use `HorseRacing.md` to design movement + BSP hybrid signals (price ratio, drift velocity, imbalance).
3. Prototype features in notebooks (see project `tests/notebooks/`).
4. Feed curated metrics to AI prompts (see `docs/Prompts/`) for automated evaluation/execution.
