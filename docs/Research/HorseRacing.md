# Horse Racing Betting Exchange Research – Structured Overview

## 1. Executive Summary
Betting exchange (Betfair) horse racing markets are **informationally efficient at the price level** but still offer **micro-structure and temporal movement edges**. Static (snapshot) odds seldom yield sustainable edge; exploitable signal arises from:
1. Short‑horizon price movement dynamics (drift / shortening / volatility clustering)
2. Liquidity flow and weight‑of‑money imbalance
3. Forecast vs. realized convergence toward the Betfair Starting Price (BSP)
4. Misalignment windows (typically 2–8 minutes pre‑off) where adjustment speed varies across runners

Robust strategies combine: (a) real‑time movement features, (b) BSP projection differentials, (c) conservative staking under commission and slippage constraints.

## 2. Market Efficiency Characteristics
Key empirical properties reported across the cited literature:
- Fast decay of autocorrelation in raw price levels → supports semi‑strong efficiency claims.
- Volatility increases non‑linearly approaching the off (spike inside last 6 minutes).
- Distribution of tick returns is short‑tailed vs. many financial assets, but **inter‑arrival times** and **directional clusters** remain partially predictable.
- BSP acts as a relatively unbiased terminal consensus benchmark; deviations earlier can be informative.

## 3. Why Static Prices Are Insufficient
| Limitation | Impact | Remedy |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Snapshot odds reflect current consensus | Little forward edge | Model evolution toward BSP / late liquidity | 
| Ignores drift speed & direction | Miss swing / scalp opportunities | Track and model incremental tick path |
| No microstructure awareness | Hidden queue & imbalance signals unused | Include weight of money & order flow |
| Neglects volatility regime shifts | Mis-specified risk sizing | Regime features (time-to-off, variance) |

## 4. Movement & Microstructure Modeling Approaches
| Approach | Core Idea | Use Case | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Compound Poisson / Skellam tick models | Model discrete up/down ticks & arrival rates | Drift likelihood, variance forecasting | Parameters time‑varying near the off |
| ACM / ACD (autoregressive conditional duration) | Model time between trades & conditional volatility | Entry timing, volatility regime detection | Duration clustering exploitable |
| ANN / CGP predictive classifiers | Learn directional next‑move / drift probability | Short horizon trading (scalp / swing) | Requires feature engineering & regularisation |
| BSP convergence regression | Project terminal BSP from early ladder states | Value screening & hedge targets | Combine with error bands for confidence |
| Imbalance & liquidity metrics | Weight of back vs lay volume & queue depth | Momentum / absorption breakouts | Sensitive to spoofing & noise |

## 5. Role of BSP (Betfair Starting Price)
| Function | Strategic Use |
|----------|---------------|
| Terminal consensus proxy | Anchor for mispricing detection |
| Calibration target | Normalize model probabilities |
| Drift endpoint | Determine mean‑reversion vs continuation |
| Value sanity check | Filter false positives from transient spikes |

Early price – projected BSP divergence gives a *directional bias hypothesis*: large positive divergence (current >> projected BSP) may imply future shortening probability; negative divergence may suggest weakening.

## 6. Strategy Design Implications
| Design Dimension | Practical Guidance |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Signal Inputs | Use movement deltas (1m, 30s, 10s), imbalance, volatility regime, BSP projection residual |
| Entry Logic | Require multi-factor confirmation (e.g., drift + sustained imbalance + BSP gap) |
| Exit Logic | Target fraction of expected drift OR time-to-off stop OR adverse move threshold |
| Staking | Kelly‑fraction capped (e.g. 2–5%) using projected edge after commission |
| Validation | Walk‑forward or anchored rolling windows; avoid single contiguous back‑test |
| Risk Controls | Max exposure per race; correlation throttle across simultaneous markets |

## 7. Core Metric Glossary
| Metric | Definition | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Pf | Forecast (industry) implied probability (1 / industry SP) | External prior baseline |
| Pm | Current market implied probability (1 / current price) | Real‑time consensus |
| Pb | BSP (or projected BSP) implied probability (1 / BSP) | More accurate terminal estimator |
| BSP Edge | Pb − Pm | Forward value vs. current price |
| Forecast Edge | Pf − Pm | Traditional bias measure |
| EV (userEvNet) | Pf × price − 1 | Classic expected value (may be noisy) |
| BSP EV Net | Pb × price − 1 | BSP‑anchored expectation |
| Price Ratio | Current price / BSP | Sweet‑spot band detection (e.g. 1.01–1.24) |
| Drift Velocity | Δprice / Δtime (multi-horizon) | Momentum / mean reversion signal |
| Imbalance | (BackVol − LayVol) / (BackVol + LayVol) | Pressure / absorption gauge |
| Kelly Fraction | Edge / odds-adj variance (capped) | Controlled stake sizing |

## 8. Edge Realisation Pathways
1. **Pre‑off Drift Capture**: Enter early on projected shortening; exit on partial convergence to BSP.
2. **Mean Reversion Scalps**: Identify overshoot vs. BSP projection with low imbalance persistence.
3. **Late Volatility Breakouts**: Use surge in traded volume & imbalance; tight adverse stop.
4. **Favourite Mispricing Filter**: Many favourites show slight overbet bias; require stronger multi-factor confirmation before backing.

## 9. Validation & Back‑Testing Recommendations
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| Data Segmentation | Rolling time‑series splits (preserve chronological order) |
| Leakage Prevention | Exclude BSP or near-off data from features predicting earlier moments |
| Metrics | ROI, Sharpe (net of commission), Hit Rate, Max Drawdown, Edge Decay |
| Statistical Tests | SPA / White Reality Check for multiple model comparisons |
| Robustness | Stress with synthetic latency & widened spreads |

## 10. Operational Considerations
| Risk / Constraint | Mitigation |
|------------------|-----------|
| Commission impact on thin edges | Demand gross edge > 1.3 × commission |
| Liquidity cliffs late | Dynamic slippage allowance; reduce size near illiquid runners |
| Overfitting to microstructure | Use parsimonious feature sets & shrinkage |
| Latency variance | Co-locate or pre-fetch ladders; asynchronous buffering |
| Correlated exposures (multiple races) | Portfolio VaR / position cap per minute |

## 11. Limitations & Caveats
- Academic models often ignore **execution frictions** (queue position, partial fills).
- BSP itself can shift materially in final seconds; projections must include confidence intervals.
- Extreme outsiders produce noisy probability transforms; consider capping odds or using logit scaling.
- Reported high ROIs (e.g. >50%) in exploratory studies may not survive realistic commission & liquidity filters.

## 12. Future Enhancement Directions
| Area | Idea |
|------|------|
| BSP Projection | Gradient boosted distributional model (mean + PI) |
| Real‑time Features | Graph embeddings of runner co-movements |
| Execution | Adaptive smart order routing across ladders |
| Risk | Bayesian dynamic Kelly fraction using posterior edge distribution |
| Monitoring | Drift attribution dashboard (imbalance vs. cross‑runner factor) |
