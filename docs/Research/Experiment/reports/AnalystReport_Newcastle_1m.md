*   **Implied Odds:** 3.0
*   **Value Score:** +31% (Strong Value)

**Key Indicators:**

*   **Timeform:** Flagged as **Horse In Form**.
*   **Data:** RPR (Racing Post Rating) of 52 and 49 last two runs, consistent with the required level for this class.

*   **Current Price:** 7.0
*   **Composite Score:** 74/100
*   **Implied Odds:** 5.0
*   **Value Score:** +28% (Value)

**Key Indicators:**
*   **Form:** Consistent recent efforts (3rd, 3rd from last two).
*   **Timeform:** Suited by Going and Distance. **Beaten Favourite Last Time Out**.
*   **Data:** Top Speed of 42 recently.
*   **Risk:** Tendency to be "headed" or "no extra" late on suggests he finds it hard to win, but looks a solid place contender.

### 3. Annalee Lass (Selection ID: 50539962)
*   **Current Price:** 4.1 (Fav)
*   **Composite Score:** 71/100
*   **Implied Odds:** 4.5

*   **Timeform:** **Suited By Going**, **Suited By Course**, **Suited By Distance**.
*   **Risk:** While the last run was good, the prior form (9th, 7th, 8th) was poor. The market may be overreacting to one good run.
*   **Conclusion:** A dangersous contender but currently too short in the betting compared to the consistency of That Lucas Fella.

### 4. Other Notable Runners
*   **Pop Favorite (@ 10.5):** Has Timeform flags for conditions but recent form (7th, 6th) is uninspiring. RPRs in the mid-40s are slightly below the top contenders.
*   **Sir Maxi (@ 13.0):** Data indicates `LastRunInDays: 11` (4th place), but historical data is sparse. Hard to support with confidence.

## 3. Market Context & Strategy

The market has installed **Annalee Lass** as the favorite, likely due to the "Suited" flags and recent improvement. However, **That Lucas Fella** boasts a far more reliable recent profile with two solid silver medals. In a Class 6 event, consistency is often the key differentiator.

**Wrist Art** is a viable alternative for Place markets or Forecasts, but **That Lucas Fella** represents the clear value on the Win market.

### Recommended Strategy:
1.  **Main Bet:** **BACK That Lucas Fella** to Win @ 4.4.
2.  **Saver/Exotic:** **Forecast** - That Lucas Fella to beat Wrist Art.
